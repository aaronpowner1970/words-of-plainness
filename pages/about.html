                <h2>About Brother Aaron</h2>
                
                <p>
                    I spent 26 years in the classroom teaching science to young people—helping them 
                    understand the natural world and discover the joy of asking good questions. Now, 
                    in what some might call retirement, I've found that the questions I most want to 
                    explore are the ones science alone can't answer.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    I'm an ordained Elder in the Melchizedek Priesthood of The Church of Jesus Christ 
                    of Latter-day Saints. My faith was shaped by years of study, service, and a mission 
                    to Argentina that changed how I see the world. But this ministry isn't about 
                    promoting one denomination over another—it's about Jesus Christ and the common 
                    ground shared by all who seek Him.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    Today, my wife and I travel in our RV, meeting people wherever we go. I host 
                    interfaith discussions in VR Chat, create music as part of the Powner Method, 
                    and write with the goal of making deep truths accessible. If you ever cross paths 
                    with a bald, bearded fellow talking about faith in a coffee shop or campground, 
                    it might be me.

                <h2>Ministry Philosophy</h2>
                
                <p>
                    <strong class="text-gold">Christ-Centered, Not Tribal.</strong> 
                    I use the phrase "Christ-centered" rather than "Christian" deliberately. 
                    The word "Christian" has become, for many, a tribal marker—a way of asking 
                    "are you one of us?" I want to point to the person of Jesus Christ rather 
                    than to any institution's claim on Him.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    <strong class="text-gold">Plainness Over Complexity.</strong> 
                    The name "Words of Plainness" comes from 2 Nephi 31:3—the idea that God speaks 
                    to His children in language they can understand. I believe truth is best served 
                    by clarity, not obscured by unnecessary complexity.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    <strong class="text-gold">Faith Expressed in Living.</strong> 
                    I believe discipleship flows naturally from love—not as a transaction to earn 
                    salvation, but as the heart's natural response to grace. "If ye love me, keep 
                    my commandments" frames obedience as love's expression, not a checkbox requirement.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    <strong class="text-gold">Bridges, Not Walls.</strong> 
                    Believers across traditions have more in common than the things that separate us. 
                    This ministry exists to explore that common ground without pretending our 
                    differences don't exist.

                    In the spirit of transparency and trust, I want to be clear about how artificial 
                    intelligence is used in this ministry.

                    I use AI tools (specifically Claude by Anthropic) to assist with editing, formatting, 
                    and refining my written content. The ideas, theology, and personal reflections are 
                    my own; AI helps me express them more clearly and consistently.

                    <strong class="text-gold">Scripture Study Tools.</strong> 
                    Some of the discipleship tools on this site use AI to help surface connections between 
                    scriptures and identify patterns in Christ's teachings. These tools are designed to 
                    support your study, not replace your personal engagement with the text.

                    or theological drift. All AI-assisted content is reviewed and verified against 
                    authoritative sources before publication. If you ever find an error, please

                <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
                
                <h3 class="text-gold" style="margin-top: 1.5rem;">Are you trying to convert people to your church?</h3>
                <p>
                    No. While I'm transparent about my Latter-day Saint background, this ministry is 
                    about following Jesus Christ and finding common ground among all who seek Him. 
                    I'm happy to answer questions about my faith tradition, but my goal is to point 
                    people to Christ, not to recruit for any institution.
                </p>
                
                <h3 class="text-gold" style="margin-top: 1.5rem;">What if I don't believe in God yet?</h3>
                <p>
                    You're welcome here. Honest questions are sacred. I'd rather walk alongside someone 
                    who's genuinely seeking than speak only to those who already agree with me.
                </p>
                
                <h3 class="text-gold" style="margin-top: 1.5rem;">Do I need to agree with you to participate?</h3>
                <p>
                    Not at all. Respectful dialogue across differences is exactly what this ministry is 
                    designed for. I learn from people who see things differently, and I hope you might 
                    find something useful here even if we disagree on some points.
                </p>
                
                <h3 class="text-gold" style="margin-top: 1.5rem;">What does "Words of Plainness" mean?</h3>
                <p>
                    It comes from 2 Nephi 31:3 in the Book of Mormon: "For my soul delighteth in plainness; 
                    for after this manner doth the Lord God work among the children of men." The idea is 
                    that spiritual truth should be communicated clearly—accessible to everyone, not just 
                    scholars or insiders.
                </p>
                
                <h3 class="text-gold" style="margin-top: 1.5rem;">How can I support this ministry?</h3>
                <p>
                    The best support is engagement—read, reflect, share what resonates, and 
                    <a href="connect.html#contact" class="text-gold">reach out</a> if you have questions 
                    or want to continue the conversation. If you'd like to support in other ways, 
                    please contact me directly.

                <h2>Glossary</h2>
                <p>
                    Terms that may be unfamiliar to visitors from different faith backgrounds. 
                    This glossary aims to bridge language differences without assuming everyone 
                    shares the same vocabulary.
                </p>
                
                <h3 class="text-gold" style="margin-top: 1.5rem;">Christ-centered</h3>
                <p>
                    Oriented around Jesus Christ as the focus of faith and practice. Used here 
                    instead of "Christian" to emphasize the person of Christ rather than 
                    institutional or denominational identity.
                </p>
                
                <h3 class="text-gold" style="margin-top: 1.5rem;">Covenant</h3>
                <p>
                    A sacred agreement between God and His people. In many Christian traditions, 
                    covenants involve promises and commitments that shape the disciple's relationship 
                    with God.
                </p>
                
                <h3 class="text-gold" style="margin-top: 1.5rem;">Discipleship</h3>
                <p>
                    The practice of following Jesus Christ—learning from His teachings, 
                    emulating His example, and growing in faith over time.
                </p>
                
                <h3 class="text-gold" style="margin-top: 1.5rem;">Latter-day Saint</h3>
                <p>
                    A member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, sometimes 
                    informally called "Mormon." The term reflects the church's belief in 
                    being Christ's covenant people in the latter days before His return.
                </p>
                
                <h3 class="text-gold" style="margin-top: 1.5rem;">Melchizedek Priesthood</h3>
                <p>
                    In Latter-day Saint theology, the higher priesthood authority, named after 
                    the ancient priest-king Melchizedek mentioned in Genesis and Hebrews. 
                    Elders in this priesthood are authorized to perform certain ordinances 
                    and serve in leadership roles.
                </p>
                
                <h3 class="text-gold" style="margin-top: 1.5rem;">Seeker</h3>
                <p>
                    Someone exploring questions of faith, meaning, and God—whether from a 
                    position of doubt, curiosity, or spiritual awakening.
                </p>
                
                <h3 class="text-gold" style="margin-top: 1.5rem;">Saint</h3>
                <p>
                    In biblical usage, simply a believer—one who follows Christ. Paul addressed 
                    his letters to "the saints" at various churches. The term doesn't imply 
                    perfection but rather dedication to discipleship.
