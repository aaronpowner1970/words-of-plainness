We are all so very human. Our wandering feet carry us along many curious and often frightening paths. Our untamed hearts pull or push us in unexpected directions. Our wide eyes marvel at the fleeting scenes of beauty and filth which unfold around us. Our grasping hands shape the environments and cultures we touch. Our unceasing voices speak much, yet too often say little. Our twitching ears are filled with the discordant noises of life. Our restless minds wrestle with the meaning of it all, desperate to forget the bitter and remember the sweet. Yet humanity occasionally manages to find itself, to gentle itself—to see, free, quiet, harmonize, and understand itself.

The writers of this book are brothers. We use the word writers because we feel that we are not the authors of any particular words of greatness. Instead, we are hunters and gatherers of knowledge. We till and seed the soils of our souls hoping to harvest wisdom.

We are native citizens of the world, yet we perceive the foreign nature of mankind's walk upon the Earth. Though our journey is not complete, my brother and I have found ourselves both on the side of right and clearly in the wrong often enough to have gained an abiding appreciation for the many profound lessons that can be gleaned from the human experience.

As a young man I, Aaron, chose to serve a mission to the people of Argentina for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. In my idealism, I hoped to bring light and goodness to people who had been less fortunate. I like to believe that I left something of value behind for the people I came to love, but I returned deeply transformed by my experiences.

The new thoughts I learned to think and the tender feelings I came to cherish during my mission planted in my heart a seed of passion for sharing things of worth with others. I returned to a world that is far more complex and fast-paced than my mission experience had been, and I found it somehow the lesser for it. In spite of this, that latent kernel of desire swelled in my heart and grew. I began searching for ideas, experiences, and things of great worth. I wrote of them. I did not know to whom I was writing. I had not considered my audience.

After some time, I suspected that I might be crafting letters to my unborn children. I came to believe that my collection of writings could become a simple legacy that I might leave behind at my journey's end. I became convinced that stories of my life, my tempering experiences, and meaningful traditions, along with my humble understandings, precious beliefs, and faith-filled encouragement are the only meaningful inheritance I can bequeath to my posterity.

When my adventures with family and children began, my yearning to gather and then write of these things became a driving need. In my late thirties, I felt a strong urge to better organize my hard-learned lessons and happy discoveries in the form of a book or collection of letters. I am not finished learning, but I felt my experience and understanding was sufficient to truly begin sharing. Spending a few hours each night, as I could spare, I finished my first rough draft in a little more than six months.

I shared my collected works with my older brother, Jim. He has long been more than an example of manhood to me; he is a trusted friend. His comments, questions, suggestions, and assistance became such an important part of editing my letters that I realized they are as much the result of his life experiences as they are of my own. Our long studies and preparations seemed to take on a life of their own. We quickly adopted the belief that such beautiful ideas and experiences must be shared in words of plainness. This philosophy became the title of our work.

We understand that the publication of such personal things may open us to criticism and unforeseen consequences. We have long considered and earnestly prayed about our decision to act in accordance with our desires. We offer our Words of Plainness to you with hope, for they are the treasured things of our souls.

The topics of our writings seem appropriate for the times in which we find ourselves. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and its members have become the subject of a surprising amount of media coverage, both favorable and not. Debate over the Church's history, beliefs, and practices appears in popular tabloids, newspapers, books, television programs, online forums, and even in widely public political arenas.

An enormous volume of misinformation and malicious propaganda exists about the restored gospel of Jesus Christ and members of the Church. During our long years as public school teachers, we struggled to convince students of the vital importance of using authoritative sources of information when doing research and in the formation of lasting opinions. Gossip columns, hate blogs, and literature critical of the Church are tantalizing reads, but they seldom offer much in the way of actual credibility. Tracing the citations and sources of such information, one finds little more than hearsay and quotations either taken out of context or hastily borrowed from other unverifiable sources.

Though false information might be presented energetically and even well-received by many, it remains fundamentally untrue. Throughout history, it has been consistently true that the odd combination of ignorance and confidence eventually leads to suffering, oppression, bigotry, and hatred.

In sharp contrast to malignant attacks and careless criticism, the writings available to the earnest seeker of truth, which have been issued by faithful Church leaders and thoughtful members, are voluminous. Excellent material on all subjects concerning the Church and its members is available. For this reason, we are not driven to write to educate or persuade, or for money, fame, or historical contribution.

Our words of plainness are offered from our hearts in gratitude for what we have found while questing for the kinds of things we feel truly matter. The purpose of this book is to share a bit of what we have learned and how we have come to feel about eternal matters. Our greatest aspiration for our writings is the sincere hope that our efforts might offer to others meaningful insight and deep encouragement toward their own life quests.

We are Latter-day Saint Christians. Our Christianity is unique. We embrace the Bible and consider ourselves fellow travelers with the faithful Christians of the world, both yesterday and today, as we seek to do the will of Jesus Christ. Our Christianity is also different from others, as we make no attempt to hide. The teachings of the restored gospel of Jesus Christ revealed in latter days expand and clarify much of what has been misunderstood during past ages.

We cherish the restored gospel, not because we believe it is better than other faith traditions, but because of what it has done and continues to do for us. It is our wellspring. With full confidence we testify that the restored gospel is also true. We have come to this knowledge through years of study, prayer, worship, trial, and the whispered confirmations of the Holy Ghost to our hearts.

Latter-day Saint Christianity is the particular lens through which my brother and I interpret and understand our lives, the world, and the nature and purposes of God. Our writings are therefore from a Latter-day Saint Christian perspective. However, our intended audience is broader than our own faith tradition.

Although we have no desire to diminish or dilute our beliefs, we hope to share them in a manner that is as broad and universal as possible. The majority of the gospel principles we share are commonly held truths among most Christian faiths, and even among those of dissimilar religions or philosophies of life. We have labored to present our writings in a style and form palatable to all. However, some of our more distinctive beliefs might be unfamiliar or new to readers. Our words of plainness about these things are offered with no intent to proselytize, but only to share. We acknowledge that our words of plainness might not be to everyone's taste.

We do not believe that those of alternative religious beliefs or philosophies of life are somehow lost. No matter what they believe, we consider all who live in accordance with their honorable and sincere beliefs, and who behave ethically and treat others with kindness, to be blessed. We believe that our Heavenly Father loves all his children equally, as any good parent would, and recognizes and honors all of the good they aspire to and become.

We believe that every faithful individual of any spiritual mindset can find eternal joy and be resurrected and exalted in worlds to come. We offer our gospel beliefs and perspectives in love and with the hope that the concepts we embrace might add to the enlightenment and enjoyment of our readers.

We have also labored to avoid politics and to allow the reader to adopt the views they wish about social issues. We hope our readers will remain focused on the spirit of the ideas we share, rather than on debates about particular policy. As with religion, we do not wish to impose our political opinions on others. Where possible, we have quoted from the scriptures. Our quotations offer confirmation and elaboration of our words of plainness. We have also cited the teachings of leaders of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, who we sustain and embrace as prophets, seers, and revelators.

We humbly offer our commentary for your consideration. They are our personal interpretations of scripture and revealed doctrine. Our personal theological or philosophical interpretations are not official doctrine of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, but represent our own study and contemplation.

We are teachers in heart and have taught in public school classrooms for the majority of our working lives. The things we share are authentic distillations of the lessons we have tried to teach and which have been taught to us by our parents, our teachers, our leaders, and our peers. We do not claim to be authorities on matters of doctrine and cannot endorse our interpretations of the gospel as more than personal views shared with the hope that they will be of value to our readers.

Our readers are encouraged to seek their own deep understandings of doctrinal matters and are advised to search the Holy Scriptures and the teachings of the prophets and apostles for things that feel right and bring them closer to God. We humbly advise that the guidance given in our writings reflects nothing more than our best understanding and current feeling.

We are sensitive to our inadequacies as authors. We understand that our words are imperfect. We anticipate that the things we believe now might be supplanted by things we may later come to learn. Our knowledge is limited. Our understanding of what we believe changes as we learn and grow. Please indulge our imperfections. We ask the reader to give ear to the things we write which may enlighten, and consider setting aside the rest for the moment.

Let us begin with a brief sketch of what it means to be a Latter-day Saint Christian. Though a complete description of the nature of our Heavenly Father, Jesus Christ, the Holy Ghost, humankind, the need for a plan of salvation, and the purpose of life could fill shelves of books, we offer only a small glimpse. The barest outline of our beliefs follows.

Every human being who has ever lived or ever will live is the spirit child of a loving Heavenly Father. His spirit children are God's greatest treasure. He loves us without limit, and his great work and glory is to bring about the immortality and eternal life of his children. To this end, He developed a plan, a great plan of happiness, to provide the opportunity for His children to live, learn, and grow.

The essentials of this plan were presented to all of His children before the physical world as we know it was created. A pillar of the plan was that each child of God would take on a physical body and be given the opportunity to experience a physical world and a physical life with others who were also learning, growing, and becoming.

The world into which we are born is as beautiful as it is harsh. Our world is both a playground and a proving ground. Pleasures and pains blend into a tumultuous yet extraordinary experience. The contrasts between right and wrong, good and evil, pleasure and pain, light and dark, and so forth are the tools our Heavenly Father uses to afford his children the opportunity to learn, grow, and progress—to become more godlike than they were before.

The experiences of this life are temporary. This mortal realm is not our original or final home. Heavenly Father's children will eventually leave mortality. Some will tragically never have an opportunity to come to this Earth. The bodies we inhabit will age and fail, and the spirit within will move on. For those who have had the opportunity to come to Earth and take on bodies, these bodies will be eternally resurrected and reunited with their spirits.

Life does not end when our mortal bodies fail—it merely changes. The life and teachings of Jesus Christ offer all people the opportunity to receive full forgiveness of their sins, be resurrected, and continue progressing throughout eternity. The atoning sacrifice of Jesus Christ is a free gift to all, given purely out of love.

Those who earnestly strive to follow the Savior and make covenants with God will have the opportunity to be exalted and receive all that the Father has. These are the treasured beliefs of Latter-day Saint Christians. The chapters of our book explain and expand upon the beliefs we have briefly sketched. We will share more about our Heavenly Father, Jesus Christ, the Holy Ghost, the nature of humanity, the plan of salvation, and the purpose of life.

There are several things you will notice right away about our book. First, we use some words uncommon in everyday English. The majority of our archaic and unusual words are found in scripture. These words are interesting, full of meaning, and worth learning. Readers are encouraged to explore such words with a dictionary. Though some might be inconvenienced by looking up unfamiliar or unusual words, we feel that expanding one's vocabulary as one grows in wisdom is fitting.

Second, readers will notice that Words of Plainness is rich in scripture references. The scriptures are a great source of truth and illumination, and no amount of description by us can accurately replicate what was originally intended by the inspired authors or compilers of the scriptures. Though we will share insights and offer our personal interpretations, our commentary is no substitute for reading the actual texts. Our scripture citations are parenthetical.

Rather than the footnotes we employed in the original print version of this book, we cite books of scripture parenthetically, by title and verse, for ease of access. For those who do not have a physical copy of the scriptures available, all references may be found at scriptures.churchofjesuschrist.org. These citations include references from the Bible, Book of Mormon, Doctrine and Covenants, and Pearl of Great Price. Our personal interpretations, as stated above, are not official Church doctrine.

Third, our book is written in a format which we hope is comfortable for all readers. We write in the first person plural, or as we, to more clearly convey the notion that our words are a product of brothers. As many of these chapters are personal stories or intimate thoughts, this choice of pronoun can become awkward. For this reason, we sometimes alternate between first person singular (I) and first person plural (we). All works are the products of both authors, regardless of which pronoun is used.

We believe our Heavenly Father is our loving father. This designation is meant with all the familial feeling such a word implies. We do not believe in a God who is a mysterious force or an eternally nebulous being of unknowable characteristics. We believe our Heavenly Father loves us, knows us, is very much like us, and in many ways is a magnified and perfected version of the loving fathers and mothers we have in mortality. Although we might ascribe the masculine pronoun to our Heavenly Father in our writing, we also embrace a Heavenly Mother. Our Heavenly Parents are one and equal, and we are children of both. While little is revealed to us of Heavenly Mother, we know She exists, and we believe She loves us.

Fourth, although we make mention of our temple covenants and temple worship in our book, we do not discuss the specific content of what we experience in the temple. We have made sacred covenants to keep these things sacred. We encourage readers who might be unfamiliar with our temples and temple work to learn more at churchofjesuschrist.org.

Fifth, we have not written our book with the intention of addressing every conceivable question or controversy. Our book is a personal work. It contains neither a broad survey of everything we believe nor a comprehensive apologetic for the faith. Our book is only the record of our personal exploration of a handful of gospel principles and personal stories, and these are presented in an order and manner which we hope will be meaningful to readers.

Sixth, although our words are written from a Latter-day Saint perspective, our intended audience is broad. We hope that seekers of all kinds will find our writings to be edifying and thought-provoking. We hope that our fellow Latter-day Saints who may read our book will also find it useful, and that they might discover in it a new angle or a fresh perspective from which to see that which they already know.

The authors have no credentials which would impress the reader. Formally, I, Aaron, studied music performance and music education in college, while my brother Jim studied mechanical engineering. Over the course of our careers as teachers, I have additionally earned secondary endorsements in chemistry, physics, mathematics, general science, and Spanish, while my brother Jim has additionally earned endorsements in English, computer technology, and physical science. These secular achievements do not qualify either of us to speak on matters of religion.

My brother and I were both born in southern California. Our parents were hardworking, middle-class people of limited formal education. They lovingly raised eight children and taught us to love God, our country, and one another. Our parents made the decision early in their marriage that Mom would be at home, and this situation remained throughout our youth and into our adult years. Dad worked outside the home with his hands and managed to provide for us by the strength of his back and the sweat of his brow.

We have not enjoyed lives free from pain and challenge. Our childhood family was not perfect in any sense of the word. We endured divorce, experienced poverty, and faced many deep struggles along the way. And yet, we feel that, in spite of our circumstances, we have been blessed. We believe the blessings we enjoy are a reflection of our earnest search for truth, our devoted worship and service, and our personal commitment to do as we understand our Heavenly Father desires.

In our adult years, both my brother and I married in the temple and have been blessed with children. Our families and our children have been at the center of our joy in mortality. My brother and I are the beneficiaries of the devotion of our magnificent wives. We are also the proud offspring of remarkable ancestry, both familial and spiritual. We owe much of who we have become to the faithful examples and dedicated nurturing of our parents, grandparents, and great-grandparents. We gratefully honor them as well as those of our spiritual ancestry, who are the humble saints who came before us in the restored Church of Jesus Christ.

The following paragraphs briefly describe how we came to faith. I, Aaron, have always felt the influence of what I believe is the Holy Spirit. The calm, persistent feelings of truth and confirmation have been my steady companions throughout my life. Doubt has been intermittent. Feelings of hope and confidence have been my normative experience with regard to the reality of my Heavenly Father, of my Savior Jesus Christ, and of the power and influence of the Holy Ghost. I will not pretend to understand why this has been my experience, as I have nothing to take credit for. A statement of my experience is all I can sincerely offer.

I served a full-time mission for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Argentina and Paraguay. I took part in helping many people with their various struggles in life. This experience was among my most treasured moments of my life. My fellow missionaries and I taught people about the restored gospel of Jesus Christ, and witnessed in many cases dramatic improvements in their lives.

Several of those we taught found the message of the restored gospel to be what they had been looking for, and have since lived their lives in accordance with their newly found faith. I do not share this to persuade. I simply share what I have seen and offer that it has blessed me to see it.

I, Jim, have also felt the gentle influence of the Holy Spirit throughout my life. Even before I was old enough to read the scriptures for myself, I heard their words as our family read them together. My mother and father taught us about God, Jesus Christ, the Holy Ghost, the plan of salvation, and the purpose of our mortal lives. What they taught us was reinforced by our teachers and leaders at church.

In my early childhood, I had no reason to doubt that what I had been taught was true. While I was still very young, my parents divorced, though both remained devoted to their faith and to the nurturing of their children. I have always loved and respected both of them. Through my teenage and early adult years, I was fortunate to find wonderful mentors, both men and women, who modeled for me what it means to live a gospel-oriented life. I am the beneficiary of a great deal of patient love.

I, Jim, attended college far from home, where I came to realize that not everyone embraces the same set of beliefs as I do. College exposed me to alternate ways of looking at the world, and led me to more deeply examine what I believed for myself. I eventually found that my questions were satisfactorily answered, and I became content with my faith.

I served a full-time mission for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in the Philippines. I shared the restored gospel of Jesus Christ with the Filipino people. My experience was, in some ways, far easier than that of my brother Aaron, and, in other ways, more challenging. Though our missions were in very different parts of the world and at very different times, we learned similar lessons through similar experiences.

Many years after our missions, our families found ourselves living within an easy drive of one another. It was there that our collaboration began in earnest. First, I assisted in Aaron's work by acting as a sounding board and making suggestions. After a time, my suggestions increased in size and began to approach chapters of their own. Early in the process, it was clear that this effort had become a joint project. The views we share in our book became the fruits of our collaboration.

Our biographies and testimonies are not impressive in any worldly sense. Our credentials do not include advanced degrees in religion or any academic achievement of the sort. We are just humble seekers of truth who have accepted Jesus Christ as our Savior. Our faith tradition is Latter-day Saint Christianity, which we have found to be beautiful, true, and deeply satisfying. Latter-day Saint Christianity has provided answers to every question which has been important to us, and has offered a framework which has brought our lives purpose and deep, abiding joy.

Our joy comes not from perfection or freedom from trial—far from it. Our joy comes from the hope we have and from the peace we feel. The restored gospel has taught us the nature of God and the purpose of our lives, and it has shown us how to move forward regardless of the trials that surround us. Our final words as we open this book are words of love. We love our Heavenly Father and His Son Jesus Christ. We love our Heavenly Mother and express our eternal devotion to Her. We love the Holy Spirit, who touches our hearts. We love our families, our friends, our coworkers, and our fellow travelers. We strive to love all people. We invite you to accept the love we offer by studying our words, praying about our words, and accepting those words and concepts that bring you closer to your Heavenly Father and the Savior of the World, Jesus Christ. Set the rest of our work aside if you find no value in it.

With love, your fellow travelers in the search for truth, Aaron and Jim.
