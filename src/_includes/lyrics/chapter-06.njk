<p class="lyrics-section"><strong>[Opening]</strong></p>
<p>I was standing at the edge of something
When the questions finally stopped
And the silence wasn't empty
It was full of what I'd lost</p>

<p>I had nothing left to offer
But a willingness to fall
And the arms that caught me whispered:
"Child—this is what I made you for"</p>

<p class="lyrics-section"><strong>[Verse 1]</strong></p>
<p>I used to think that faith meant certainty
That knowing was enough
But even demons believe in Him
And they tremble at the truth</p>

<p>It wasn't facts that finally freed me
It was falling to my knees
It was opening these hands I'd clenched so tight
And letting myself breathe</p>

<p class="lyrics-section"><strong>[Pre-Chorus]</strong></p>
<p>What I thought was strength was prison
What I thought was loss is gain
Every wall I built for safety
Was the architecture of my chains</p>

<p class="lyrics-section"><strong>[Chorus 1]</strong></p>
<p><em>I have tasted the Light
Grace of the Living Son of God
And my heart is full, my heart is full</em></p>

<p><em>His truth rises within me like the morning sun
And it calls me to move
Oh, it calls me to move</em></p>

<p><em>I will dance before the Lord
With all the life He's given me
I'll use these hands to bear His light</em></p>

<p><em>Now I'm reborn
Now I'm free</em></p>

<p class="lyrics-section"><strong>[Verse 2]</strong></p>
<p>The world looks just the same this morning
But I swear these eyes are new
Something ancient woke inside me
Something deathless, something true</p>

<p>How do I explain this healing
To a heart that's never broke?
But the ones who've tasted know—
The Spirit witnessed. Now I know.</p>

<p class="lyrics-section"><strong>[Chorus 2]</strong></p>
<p><em>I have tasted the Light
Grace of the Living Son of God
And my heart is full, my heart is full</em></p>

<p><em>His truth rises within me like the morning sun
And it calls me to move
Oh, it calls me to move</em></p>

<p><em>I will dance before the Lord
With all the life He's given me
I'll use these hands to bear His light</em></p>

<p><em>Now I'm reborn
Now I'm free</em></p>

<p class="lyrics-section"><strong>[Verse 3]</strong></p>
<p>Like the woman at the well
I ran to tell what I had found
Not because my life was perfect—
Because His mercy wore me down</p>

<p>We are not called to walk in silence
We are not called to walk alone
There's a family, there's a table
There's a testimony—there's a home</p>

<p class="lyrics-section"><strong>[Bridge]</strong></p>
<p>When the shadows press their questions
And the old doubts claw their way
I return to the moment
When He spoke and night became day</p>

<p>What witness could be greater
Than the peace He put in me?
So I choose to remember—
And the Light comes back to me</p>

<p class="lyrics-section"><strong>[Interlude]</strong></p>
<p><em>Come unto Him
Learn of Him
Believe in Him
Follow Him
Remember Him</em></p>

<p class="lyrics-section"><strong>[Final Chorus]</strong></p>
<p><em>I have tasted the Light
Grace of the Living Son of God
And my heart is full, my heart is full!</em></p>

<p><em>His truth rises within me like the morning sun
And it calls me to move
Oh, it calls me to move!</em></p>

<p><em>I will dance before the Lord
With all the life He's given me
I'll use these hands to bear His light!</em></p>

<p><em>Now I'm reborn
Now I'm free!</em></p>

<p class="lyrics-section"><strong>[Outro]</strong></p>
<p><em>Now I'm reborn...
Now I'm free...</em></p>

<p><em>I have tasted the Light</em>
(Grace of the Living Son of God)
<em>I have tasted the Light</em>
(My heart is full, my heart is full)</p>

<p><em>I have tasted the Light...</em>
In the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.</p>
