<p>I was standing at the edge of something
when the questions finally stopped.</p>

<p>Not answered. Stopped.
Like a wind that's been howling so long
you forgot what silence sounds like.
And then it stops.</p>

<p>And the silence wasn't empty.
It was full of everything I'd been too loud to hear.</p>

<p>I had nothing left to offer.
No arguments. No conditions. No backup plan.
Just a willingness—
finally—
to fall.</p>

<p>And the arms that caught me
whispered something I'd been running from
my whole life:</p>

<p><em>Child—this is what I made you for.</em></p>

<hr>

<p>I used to think that faith meant certainty.
That if I could know enough,
understand enough,
build a wall of evidence high enough—
I'd be safe.</p>

<p>But even the demons believe.
James tells us that.
Even the demons believe,
and they tremble at the truth.</p>

<p>So what was I doing that was any different?</p>

<p>It wasn't facts that finally freed me.
It was falling to my knees.
It was opening these hands I'd clenched so tight
the knuckles had gone white.
And letting myself
breathe.</p>

<p>What I thought was strength
was prison.
What I thought was loss
is gain.
Every wall I built for safety
was the architecture of my chains.</p>

<hr>

<p><em>I have tasted the Light.</em></p>

<p><em>Grace of the Living Son of God.</em></p>

<hr>

<p>The world looks the same this morning.
Same sun. Same street. Same cracks in the sidewalk.
But I swear—these eyes are new.</p>

<p>Something ancient woke inside me.
Something that was always there
but sleeping—
buried under all my noise,
all my striving,
all my desperate, grasping need to be right.</p>

<p>Something deathless.
Something true.</p>

<p>And how do I explain that?
How do I explain this healing
to a heart that's never broke?</p>

<p>You can't describe water to someone
who's never been thirsty.
You can't describe home to someone
who's never been lost.</p>

<p>But the ones who've tasted—
they know.</p>

<p>The Spirit witnessed.</p>

<p>Now I know.</p>

<p><em>His truth rises within me like the morning sun.</em>
Not an argument. Not a proof.
A sunrise.
You don't argue with the sunrise.
You don't need evidence that morning has come.
You just open your eyes,
and there it is.</p>

<hr>

<p><em>And it calls me to move.</em></p>

<p>Do you hear that?
<em>It CALLS me to move!</em></p>

<p>I will dance before the Lord
with all the life He's given me.
I'll use these hands—
these hands that were clenched,
these hands that were fists,
these hands that held onto everything
because I was terrified of letting go—</p>

<p>I'll use these hands to bear His light.</p>

<p>Because His mercy wore me down!
Not like a storm wears down a cliff—
like a river wears down a stone.
Patient.
Relentless.
Kind.</p>

<p>He didn't break down my door.
He knocked.
And knocked.
And knocked.
Until the day I finally opened it
and realized
He'd been standing there the whole time.</p>

<p><em>Now I'm reborn.</em>
<em>Now I'm FREE.</em></p>

<p><em>I have tasted the Light!</em></p>

<p>And my heart is full.</p>

<p><em>My heart is full.</em></p>

<hr>

<p>Like the woman at the well,
I ran to tell what I had found.</p>

<p>Not because my life was perfect—
not because I had it figured out—
because His mercy wore me down
and I couldn't keep it to myself.</p>

<p>That's what testimony does.
It doesn't wait until you're ready.
It doesn't wait until you're worthy.
It pours out of you
the way water pours out of a spring—
not because it's trying to go anywhere,
but because that's what springs do.</p>

<p>We are not called to walk in silence.
We are not called to walk alone.
There is a family.
There is a table.
There is a testimony.
There is a home.</p>

<p>When the shadows press their questions—
and they will—
when the old doubts come clawing back—
and they will—</p>

<p>I return to the moment
when He spoke
and night became day.</p>

<p>What witness could be greater
than the peace He put in me?</p>

<p>So I choose to remember.
And the Light comes back.
It always comes back.</p>

<p><em>Come unto Him.</em>
<em>Learn of Him.</em>
<em>Believe in Him.</em>
<em>Follow Him.</em>
<em>Remember Him.</em></p>

<hr>

<p><em>I have tasted the Light.</em></p>

<p>In the name of Jesus Christ.
Amen.</p>
