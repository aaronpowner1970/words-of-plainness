  <div class="spoken-word-lyrics">

I was standing at the edge of something
when the questions finally stopped.

Not answered. Stopped.
Like a wind that's been howling so long
you forgot what silence sounds like.
And then it stops.

And the silence wasn't empty.
It was full of everything I'd been too loud to hear.

I had nothing left to offer.
No arguments. No conditions. No backup plan.
Just a willingness—
finally—
to fall.

And the arms that caught me
whispered something I'd been running from
my whole life:

*Child—this is what I made you for.*

---

I used to think that faith meant certainty.
That if I could know enough,
understand enough,
build a wall of evidence high enough—
I'd be safe.

But even the demons believe.
James tells us that.
Even the demons believe,
and they tremble at the truth.

So what was I doing that was any different?

It wasn't facts that finally freed me.
It was falling to my knees.
It was opening these hands I'd clenched so tight
the knuckles had gone white.
And letting myself
breathe.

What I thought was strength
was prison.
What I thought was loss
is gain.
Every wall I built for safety
was the architecture of my chains.

---

*I have tasted the Light.*

*Grace of the Living Son of God.*

---

The world looks the same this morning.
Same sun. Same street. Same cracks in the sidewalk.
But I swear—these eyes are new.

Something ancient woke inside me.
Something that was always there
but sleeping—
buried under all my noise,
all my striving,
all my desperate, grasping need to be right.

Something deathless.
Something true.

And how do I explain that?
How do I explain this healing
to a heart that's never broke?

You can't describe water to someone
who's never been thirsty.
You can't describe home to someone
who's never been lost.

But the ones who've tasted—
they know.

The Spirit witnessed.

Now I know.

*His truth rises within me like the morning sun.*
Not an argument. Not a proof.
A sunrise.
You don't argue with the sunrise.
You don't need evidence that morning has come.
You just open your eyes,
and there it is.

---

*And it calls me to move.*

Do you hear that?
*It CALLS me to move!*

I will dance before the Lord
with all the life He's given me.
I'll use these hands—
these hands that were clenched,
these hands that were fists,
these hands that held onto everything
because I was terrified of letting go—

I'll use these hands to bear His light.

Because His mercy wore me down!
Not like a storm wears down a cliff—
like a river wears down a stone.
Patient.
Relentless.
Kind.

He didn't break down my door.
He knocked.
And knocked.
And knocked.
Until the day I finally opened it
and realized
He'd been standing there the whole time.

*Now I'm reborn.*
*Now I'm FREE.*

*I have tasted the Light!*

And my heart is full.

*My heart is full.*

---

Like the woman at the well,
I ran to tell what I had found.

Not because my life was perfect—
not because I had it figured out—
because His mercy wore me down
and I couldn't keep it to myself.

That's what testimony does.
It doesn't wait until you're ready.
It doesn't wait until you're worthy.
It pours out of you
the way water pours out of a spring—
not because it's trying to go anywhere,
but because that's what springs do.

We are not called to walk in silence.
We are not called to walk alone.
There is a family.
There is a table.
There is a testimony.
There is a home.

When the shadows press their questions—
and they will—
when the old doubts come clawing back—
and they will—

I return to the moment
when He spoke
and night became day.

What witness could be greater
than the peace He put in me?

So I choose to remember.
And the Light comes back.
It always comes back.

*Come unto Him.*
*Learn of Him.*
*Believe in Him.*
*Follow Him.*
*Remember Him.*

---

*I have tasted the Light.*

In the name of Jesus Christ.
Amen.

<h2 id="you-have-come-this-far">{% sentence 0 %}You Have Come This Far on the Journey{% endsentence %}</h2>

{% sentence 1 %}If you have made it to this chapter, then you have searched in plainness.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 2 %}You have asked honest questions about the purpose of your existence.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 3 %}You have considered the limits of human knowledge and explored the possibility of spiritual knowledge and wisdom.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 4 %}You have learned to pray—to speak to God and listen for His voice.{% endsentence %}

{% sentence 5 %}And now?{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 6 %}Have you attempted prayer and listening for God's still small voice?{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 7 %}Have you planted the seed of the gospel within yourself?{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 8 %}Has the seed begun to swell within you (Alma 32)?{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 9 %}Have you tasted something sweet—a warmth in your heart, a clarity in your mind, a peace you cannot quite explain?{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 10 %}Do you stand at the threshold, willing to believe but not yet certain, hoping that what you have heard is true?{% endsentence %}

*Lyric: "I have tasted the Light, Grace of the Living Son of God, and my heart is full."*

{% sentence 11 %}Then you are ready for what comes next.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 12 %}This chapter is not about convincing you to search.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 13 %}You are already searching.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 14 %}It is about what faith in Jesus Christ actually is—and what it does to those who embrace it.{% endsentence %}

<h2 id="more-than-belief">{% sentence 15 %}More Than Belief{% endsentence %}</h2>

{% sentence 16 %}Faith is not mere belief.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 17 %}The scriptures are clear on this point: "The devils also believe, and tremble" (James 2:19).{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 18 %}Satan and his servants know that God exists.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 19 %}They know Jesus is the Christ.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 20 %}Satan's knowledge of this fact is perfect—and it brings him only misery.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 21 %}So then, what separates saving faith from the belief of devils?{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 22 %}What more is there?{% endsentence %}

{% sentence 23 %}Surrender.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 24 %}Trust.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 25 %}Willingness to be changed by the power of God.{% endsentence %}

{% sentence 26 %}Belief says, "I acknowledge this is true." Faith says, "I will stake my life on it.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 27 %}I will let it reshape me.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 28 %}And I will make the sacrifices necessary to follow where it leads."{% endsentence %}

{% sentence 29 %}Faith is not passive.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 30 %}It is an action word in a variety of languages—English, Spanish, Italian, French, Latin, German, Greek, Hebrew—and it has meant throughout the ages "to be persuaded to the point of trust, reliance, and loyalty; to highly value and truly love; and to make a strong commitment."{% endsentence %}

{% sentence 31 %}Scripture describes faith as "the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen" (Hebrews 11:1).{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 32 %}Faith is also defined as hope for things "which are not seen, which are true" (Alma 32:21)—emphasis on "true."{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 33 %}It is trusting in what is real before we have full proof of it.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 34 %}Surprisingly, God often chooses not to reveal Himself or confirm our faith through the witness of His Spirit "until after the trial of [our] faith" (Ether 12:6).{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 35 %}Spiritual experiences and divine evidence come to those who step forward, not to those who demand proof before they will move.{% endsentence %}

{% sentence 36 %}Faith is also the principle of change—the force that moves us from knowing to becoming.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 37 %}Joseph Smith taught that faith is "the moving cause of all action" and "the principle of power also, in all intelligent beings, whether in heaven or on earth" (Lectures on Faith 1:13, 15).{% endsentence %}

{% sentence 38 %}Scriptures indicate that God's power to create and destroy stems not only from His wisdom, understanding, and knowledge but also from His own spiritual faith; the same kind of faith that Christ taught (Matthew 17:20).{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 39 %}Faith is the real principle of power in heaven (Hebrews 11:3).{% endsentence %}

{% sentence 40 %}When we exercise faith—though small and imperfect—we take hold of that same principle that called light out of darkness, that formed the Earth and life upon it.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 41 %}It is that potent faculty that caused the blind to receive their sight, and the lame to walk, the lepers to be cleansed, the deaf to hear, and the dead to be raised up (Matthew 11:5).{% endsentence %}

{% sentence 42 %}And here is the beautiful paradox: faith begins as we reach toward God, but it becomes His gift to us as He reaches back.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 43 %}We extend a particle of hope, and He returns it multiplied into knowledge.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 44 %}We offer a desire to believe; He transforms it into testimony.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 45 %}Faith combines our willingness and His grace.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 46 %}The two become entangled, eventually so woven together that we cannot tell where one ends and the other begins.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 47 %}Faith is best described as one's relationship with God.{% endsentence %}

*Lyric: "His truth rises in me like the morning sun, and it calls me to move."*

<h2 id="born-again">{% sentence 48 %}Born Again{% endsentence %}</h2>

{% sentence 49 %}Jesus taught that unless we are born again, we cannot see the kingdom of God.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 50 %}This is not just a metaphor.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 51 %}It is the Good Physician's prescription for salvation.{% endsentence %}

{% sentence 52 %}Those who have experienced the promised "rebirth" speak of a mighty change of heart—not self-improvement through one's own will and works (Ephesians 2:8–9) but a transformation of the whole soul by the miraculous power of God (2 Corinthians 5:17, Ephesians 4:23–24, Ezekiel 36:26, Mosiah 27:25–26, Alma 5:14).{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 53 %}We do not reach personal perfection in this mortal life (Hebrews 10:14), but we receive a glimpse of God's perfect and eternal love for us.{% endsentence %}

{% sentence 54 %}In words of plainness, being born again is a divine miracle—the most powerful display of godly might—resulting in a conversion of character.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 55 %}What does it feel like?{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 56 %}It is finding freedom from the burden of guilt of past sins following sincere repentance.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 57 %}It is a new beginning, an abiding sense of freshness and purity, a spiritual renewal.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 58 %}The world is still the same, but you are different, and so you see all of creation through new eyes.{% endsentence %}

{% sentence 59 %}For some, the new birth arrives like lightning—sudden, unmistakable, unforgettable.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 60 %}For others, it comes like dawn—so gradual they cannot name the moment the light became unmistakable.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 61 %}Both experiences are authentic.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 62 %}God works uniquely with each soul.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 63 %}What matters is whether the tree of faith is growing within us, not how dramatically the seed of salvation first sprouted.{% endsentence %}

{% sentence 64 %}Remember how Alma compared the word of God to a seed (Alma 32:28–43)?{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 65 %}This soul-enriching transformation is what the seed becomes when it takes root.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 66 %}He promised: the word would "enlarge your soul" and "enlighten your understanding" and become "delicious" to you.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 67 %}The swelling within, the growing inner light, the sweetness of spiritual freedom—these are signs of the new birth beginning.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 68 %}It is the light of Christ entering your life not as a concept or subtle influence but as a living, divine presence.{% endsentence %}

{% sentence 69 %}We cannot spiritually save ourselves.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 70 %}We can only say yes to the One who offers to make us new.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 71 %}And when His Spirit moves through our spirit, when we feel the old self falling away, we then begin to understand why Jesus used the language of birth.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 72 %}It is profound.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 73 %}It is real.{% endsentence %}

*Lyric: "Now I'm reborn. Now I'm free."*

<h2 id="surrender-as-strength">{% sentence 74 %}Surrender as Strength{% endsentence %}</h2>

{% sentence 75 %}The world teaches that surrender is weakness.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 76 %}To yield is to lose.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 77 %}To submit is to be conquered.{% endsentence %}

{% sentence 78 %}But surrender to Christ is victory.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 79 %}It is the only true freedom in this world.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 80 %}When we try to hold our lives together through force of will alone, we forge chains of pride that weigh us down.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 81 %}The illusion of control—the fear we think is keeping us safe—becomes a prison cell with bars we refuse to see.{% endsentence %}

{% sentence 82 %}When we let go and then fall into His arms, we discover He was not waiting to diminish us but to enlarge our souls—to fill us with His light, His love, and even His own life.{% endsentence %}

{% sentence 83 %}This is why those who have surrendered to Christ do not speak of loss but of gain.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 84 %}They speak not of bondage but of liberation.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 85 %}Serving Him is not a grim duty.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 86 %}It is a homecoming for the travel-worn heart, a new vocation for restless hands.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 87 %}It is the song a once-quiet voice cannot stop singing—and the dance of feet that will not be still before the Lord (2 Samuel 6:14, Psalm 149:3).{% endsentence %}

*Lyric: "I will dance before the Lord with all the life He's given me."*

<h2 id="grace-faith-and-works">{% sentence 88 %}Grace, Faith, and Works{% endsentence %}</h2>

{% sentence 89 %}Are we saved by what God does for us?{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 90 %}Or are we saved by what we do for God?{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 91 %}The answer to both questions is yes.{% endsentence %}

{% sentence 92 %}There was great debate about this in Paul's time.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 93 %}The cause was lingering loyalties of the early Christians to the Jewish practices under the Mosaic Law.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 94 %}Many had faith in Christ, but continued to believe that they could only be saved by observing the traditions and rituals of the Law of Moses.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 95 %}Paul explained, "A man is not justified by the works of the law, but by the faith of Jesus Christ... for by the works of the law shall no flesh be justified" (Galatians 2:16).{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 96 %}Paul was not saying faith is superior to obedience to Christ's commandments.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 97 %}Rather, he was dissuading the Saints from observance of the Law of Moses, whose prophecies and ordinances had at long last been fulfilled by the atonement of Jesus Christ, who was God's promised Messiah to the people of Israel.{% endsentence %}

{% sentence 98 %}Returning to the question at hand, does salvation come by grace or works?{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 99 %}Again, we answer: Both!{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 100 %}Paul wrote, "By grace are ye saved through faith" (Ephesians 2:8).{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 101 %}But the Apostle James wrote, "What doth it profit, my brethren, though a man say he hath faith, and have not works?{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 102 %}Can faith save him?" He then answered his own question, saying, "Faith, if it hath not works, is dead, being alone" (James 2:14, 17).{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 103 %}Both Apostles of Jesus Christ were right.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 104 %}There is no opposition between faith and works.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 105 %}These two elements of salvation are companions in a godly relationship.{% endsentence %}

{% sentence 106 %}Grace is God reaching toward us—unearned, undeserved, freely offered.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 107 %}It completes what we cannot complete on our own.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 108 %}But grace that is truly received changes us.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 109 %}It does not leave us where it found us.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 110 %}When God's love enters a heart, that heart beats differently.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 111 %}Hands once closed into fists begin to open.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 112 %}Feet that were still begin to move.{% endsentence %}

*Lyric: "I'll use these hands to bear His light."*

{% sentence 113 %}Good works are not payment in exchange for salvation.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 114 %}The strong desire to do good in the world is a natural byproduct of receiving saving grace and experiencing the transformation of one's spirit, the fruit of the Spirit of God (Galatians 5:22–23).{% endsentence %}

{% sentence 115 %}"We are God's workmanship, created in Christ Jesus to do good works, which God prepared in advance for us to do" (Ephesians 2:10).{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 116 %}A tree does not bear fruit to prove it deserves sunlight but because that is what living trees do with light.{% endsentence %}

<h2 id="perfection-in-christ">{% sentence 117 %}Perfection in Christ{% endsentence %}</h2>

{% sentence 118 %}Scriptures have good news on this subject.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 119 %}"By one sacrifice He has perfected forever those who are being made holy" (Hebrews 10:14).{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 120 %}We can also be confident of this: "He that began a good work in you will carry it on to completion" (Philippians 1:6).{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 121 %}But we cannot allow ourselves to get cocky (Hebrews 6:4–6, 2 Peter 2:20–22).{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 122 %}This is not a license to sin.{% endsentence %}

{% sentence 123 %}We do not believe that reaching perfection in this mortal lifetime is required to be saved in Heaven (Luke 23:43), though we are commanded to be perfect (Matthew 5:48).{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 124 %}For now, perfection is the persistent direction of the journey, not the price of admission to the Kingdom of God; Christ's grace has already paid that price.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 125 %}Christ commands us to aim at the Father's wholeness, and grace carries us forward when we fall short (2 Nephi 25:23, Romans 3:23).{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 126 %}The consistent direction of our growth matters far more than any level of attainment.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 127 %}Genuine faith produces genuine change.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 128 %}If nothing is growing, we might ask whether the seed was ever truly planted, protected, nourished, and encouraged to produce fruit (Matthew 13:1–23).{% endsentence %}

<h2 id="fellowship-with-disciples">{% sentence 129 %}Fellowship with Disciples{% endsentence %}</h2>

{% sentence 130 %}Faith in Christ is personal, but it is not private.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 131 %}From the beginning, the Lord has gathered His followers into communities of covenant and care.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 132 %}He calls us not only to Himself but to one another (Hebrews 10:24–25, Alma 6:6, Moroni 6:5–6).{% endsentence %}

*Lyric: "We are not called to walk alone. There's a family... there's a home."*

{% sentence 133 %}There are things that can only be learned in fellowship.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 134 %}Patience is forged when we must bear with one another's weaknesses.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 135 %}Forgiveness is practiced when brothers and sisters disappoint us—as we inevitably disappoint them.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 136 %}Love is perfected not in solitude but in the daily friction and grace of life together.{% endsentence %}

{% sentence 137 %}The early Christians "continued steadfastly in the apostles' doctrine and fellowship, and in breaking of bread, and in prayers" (Acts 2:42).{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 138 %}They understood that discipleship is communal.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 139 %}We need teachers to instruct us, elders to guide us, peers to walk beside us, and younger souls to serve.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 140 %}We need the sacraments that can only be administered in gathered worship.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 141 %}We need the correction that comes from those who know us well enough to speak truth in love.{% endsentence %}

{% sentence 142 %}Do not try to follow Christ alone.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 143 %}Find His people.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 144 %}Join them.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 145 %}Bear their burdens as they bear yours.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 146 %}"Where two or three are gathered together in my name," Jesus promised, "there am I in the midst of them" (Matthew 18:20).{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 147 %}His presence is found in the fellowship as surely as in the private places of prayer.{% endsentence %}

{% sentence 148 %}The body of Christ is not a metaphor.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 149 %}It is a description of how His living work is done in the world—through hands and feet and voices joined together in His service.{% endsentence %}

<div class="admonition">

{% sentence 150 %}<span class="star-icon">۞</span> **Admonition:** Be wary of seeking a congregation that offers only pleasing doctrines and affirmation without accountability.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 151 %}The body of Christ is a family, and families speak truth to one another—sometimes uncomfortable truth.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 152 %}If no one in your fellowship ever challenges you, you may have found an audience, not a family.{% endsentence %}

<div class="admonition">

{% sentence 154 %}Few were condemned more harshly than the self-righteous Pharisees, whom Jesus condemned for hypocrisy, scriptural legalism, making religion burdensome to their communities, greed, vanity, ambition, and personal pride.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 155 %}These things destroy tender hearts and divide communities, leading away from the plainness of practicing the Lord's grace and compassion.{% endsentence %}

{% sentence 163 %}True discipleship to Christ cannot be judged by mortals.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 164 %}Though important to institutionalized religion, human councils cannot determine the nature of spiritual matters with the same wisdom and divine authority possessed by the Savior and Judge of our souls!{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 165 %}The purity of one's faith can neither be measured nor diminished by ecumenical creeds, formal catechisms, articles of faith, or ecclesiastical courts.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 166 %}Being a Christian has little to do with doctrines or theologies of religious institutions.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 167 %}A true Christian—a sincere disciple of Christ—is one who has faith enough in Jesus to try to become more like Him.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 168 %}This being said, there are a few basic beliefs and practices held by most disciples of Christ.{% endsentence %}

<div class="principles">

{% sentence 169 %}<span class="star-icon">۞</span> **Principle:** God lives and we are His children.{% endsentence %}

<h2 id="the-cross-of-christ">{% sentence 178 %}The Cross of Christ{% endsentence %}</h2>

{% sentence 179 %}Jesus said that if anyone wishes to follow Him he should "deny himself, and take up his cross" (Matthew 16:24).{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 180 %}The prophet Jacob described followers of the Holy One of Israel as those "who have endured the crosses of the world" (2 Nephi 9:18).{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 181 %}Simon of Cyrene was compelled to literally bear the cross of Christ (Matthew 27:32).{% endsentence %}

{% sentence 182 %}Paul wrote of the saving effect of the cross of Christ (1 Corinthians 1:17).{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 183 %}He also wrote of the saving blood of the cross (Colossians 1:20).{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 184 %}Does this mean that we cannot be saved unless we adorn ourselves, our homes, and our places of worship with crosses?{% endsentence %}

{% sentence 185 %}Truly consider, was it the physical wooden cross that is of saving effect and which bled for our sins, or was it the unparalleled suffering, sacrifice, death, and resurrection of God's own Son that can save us?{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 186 %}For the early Apostles the cross became a powerful symbol of bearing great burdens or making great sacrifices, but they did not worship the cross; they worshiped the One who was crucified.{% endsentence %}

<h2 id="taking-the-name-of-christ">{% sentence 187 %}Taking the Name of Christ Upon Us{% endsentence %}</h2>

{% sentence 188 %}We believe that all who call themselves Christians have taken the name of Christ upon themselves to some degree.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 189 %}Any who deny this lack understanding or simple Christlike charity.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 190 %}It is a sorrowful thing that surely displeases the Father of our spirits to see Christians denying the Christianity of other Christians, like some form of tribal warfare.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 191 %}However, no one can be justified by merely taking the name of Christ on their lips.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 192 %}To be worthy to be called Christians we must take Him into our heart, and then take up His cross in conforming our lives, thoughts, and attitudes to His teachings.{% endsentence %}

*Lyric: "How do I explain this healing to a heart that's never broken?"*

<h2 id="bearing-testimony">{% sentence 193 %}Bearing Testimony{% endsentence %}</h2>

{% sentence 194 %}Faith that remains hidden is faith that remains incomplete.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 195 %}The natural response to encountering the living Christ is to speak of Him—to bear testimony.{% endsentence %}

{% sentence 196 %}Consider the woman at the well.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 197 %}She had lived a complicated life—five husbands, and the man she was with was not her husband.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 198 %}Yet when she encountered Christ, she did not wait until her life was in order to speak of Him.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 199 %}She left her waterpot and ran to the city: "Come, see a man, which told me all things that ever I did: is not this the Christ?" (John 4:29).{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 200 %}Her testimony was simple, honest, and immediate.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 201 %}And many believed because of her word.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 202 %}She did not argue theology.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 203 %}She simply said, "Come and see." That is testimony.{% endsentence %}

{% sentence 204 %}A testimony is not an argument.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 205 %}It is not proof designed to compel agreement.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 206 %}It is a witness shared: a personal declaration of what you have experienced, what you have come to know, what has changed in you because of Him.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 207 %}"I was blind, but now I see." "I was lost, but He found me." "I planted the seed, and it grew." No one can argue with your experience.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 208 %}They can only hear it and feel the Spirit confirm its truth (or not) to their own hearts.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 209 %}We are not the Savior; we cannot change others by force of will or with compelling arguments and proofs.{% endsentence %}

{% sentence 210 %}Further, testimony is borne in more than words.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 211 %}It is borne in how you live—in the kindness you show, the integrity you keep, the peace you carry into anxious rooms.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 212 %}Every act of Christlike love is testimony.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 213 %}We bear plain witness of His love and express discipleship with every choice to forgive when the world says we should retaliate.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 214 %}The life you live preaches sermons that never end.{% endsentence %}

{% sentence 215 %}Jesus said, "Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven" (Matthew 5:16).{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 216 %}This is testimony in action—light borne into darkness, not for your own glory but for His.{% endsentence %}

*Lyric: "It calls me to move. Oh, it calls me to move."*

{% sentence 217 %}Do not wait until your faith is perfect to share it.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 218 %}Testimony grows stronger in the telling.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 219 %}As you speak what you know—however small it seems—the Spirit confirms it to you even as it reaches toward others.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 220 %}The seed you plant in another's heart waters the growing tree of faith in your own.{% endsentence %}

<h2 id="when-faith-is-tested">{% sentence 221 %}When Faith Is Tested{% endsentence %}</h2>

{% sentence 222 %}There will be seasons when the light of faith dims.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 223 %}The world grows loud and distracting: teachings and philosophies of the world, hardships and loss, betrayal by friends, and even by brothers and sisters in Christ.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 224 %}Hardship can obscure what once seemed clear.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 225 %}Doubt sometimes creeps in where certainty lives.{% endsentence %}

*Lyric: "When shadows press their questions, and the doubts claw their way..."*

{% sentence 226 %}Know this: doubt is not the opposite of faith.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 227 %}Fear and despair are.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 228 %}Doubt that keeps seeking is still faith, just dressed in different clothes.{% endsentence %}

{% sentence 229 %}The Lord counseled a struggling disciple: "Cast your mind upon the night that you cried unto me in your heart.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 230 %}Did I not speak peace to your mind concerning the matter?{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 231 %}What greater witness can you have than from God?" (D&C 6:22–23).{% endsentence %}

{% sentence 232 %}Remind yourself that you have felt the Spirit of God before.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 233 %}The seed has swelled within.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 234 %}The light tasted sweet then.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 235 %}Return to that memory.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 236 %}Let it anchor you until the sun rises again within you.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 237 %}Faith is both a gift and a choice—God gives the witness; we choose whether to remember it.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 238 %}Return to the wellspring of living waters often.{% endsentence %}

<h2 id="the-invitation">{% sentence 239 %}The Invitation{% endsentence %}</h2>

{% sentence 240 %}Faith offers to us: a heart made full, a life made new, a purpose that outlasts death.{% endsentence %}

{% sentence 241 %}Faith asks of us: surrender, trust, willingness to be changed and to let that change overflow into how you live and love and serve.{% endsentence %}

{% sentence 242 %}Faith grows into: testimony borne in word and deed, fellowship with other disciples, light carried into every room you enter, joy that cannot be contained.{% endsentence %}

*Lyric: "Now I'm reborn. Now I'm free."*

*{% sentence 243 %}<span class="star-icon">۞</span> Come unto Him.{% endsentence %}*

{% sentence 249 %}"Then shall thy confidence wax strong in the presence of God" (D&C 121:45).{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 250 %}You will know—not merely believe, but know—that Jesus Christ is the Son of God, the Savior of all who receive Him, and that embracing Him is not loss but gain, not bondage but freedom, not the end of your journey but its true beginning.{% endsentence %}
