  <p class="section"><strong>[Verse 1]</strong></p>
  <p class="verse">There's a hunger deep inside I cannot name<br>
  Feelin' homesick for a place I've never known<br>
  Filled it up with pride and empty pleasure<br>
  Oh, but bitter waters never satisfy</p>

  <p class="section"><strong>[Verse 2]</strong></p>
  <p class="verse">I've walked roads of despair and rebellion<br>
  Let go of who I was to fit a mold<br>
  Made excuses out of worldly wisdom<br>
  But clever words can't warm a weary soul</p>

  <p class="section"><strong>[Chorus]</strong></p>
  <p class="chorus">Seek and you will find<br>
  Knock and the door swings open wide<br>
  There's a humble road between the shadows<br>
  Where the hungry come to find the light<br>
  The search is worth the risking<br>
  Every question, every climb<br>
  Seek and you will find</p>

  <p class="section"><strong>[Verse 3]</strong></p>
  <p class="verse">I see it now through a glass so darkly<br>
  But even shadows cannot hide what's true<br>
  There's meaning waiting just past my understanding<br>
  A living water, crystal, still, and free<br>
  <em>Reflecting back the face of God in me</em></p>

  <p class="section"><strong>[Chorus]</strong></p>
  <p class="chorus">Seek and you will find<br>
  Knock and the door swings open wide<br>
  There's a humble road between the shadows<br>
  Where the hungry come to find the light<br>
  The search is worth the risking<br>
  Every question, every climb<br>
  Seek and you will find</p>

  <p class="section"><strong>[Bridge]</strong></p>
  <p class="bridge">Between the pride and the despair<br>
  Between the running and standing still<br>
  There's a narrow way for honest seekers<br>
  Where the deepest thirst is finally filled</p>

  <p class="section"><strong>[Final Chorus]</strong></p>
  <p class="chorus">Seek and you will find<br>
  Knock and the door swings open wide<br>
  There's a humble road between the shadows<br>
  Where the hungry come to find the light<br>
  The search is worth the risking<br>
  Worth any sacrifice<br>
  Seek and you will find<br>
  Seek and you will find</p>

  <p class="section"><strong>[Outro]</strong></p>
  <p class="verse"><em>The hunger was no curse<br>
  God planted it on purpose<br>
  A holy homesickness<br>
  To lead me home</em></p>

podcastTranscript: |
  <p><strong>Jordan:</strong> Mr. Powner? Is that—wait, is that actually you?</p>

  <p><strong>Aaron:</strong> Jordan! Wow! How long has it been—six, seven years?</p>

  <p><strong>Jordan:</strong> Almost ten years! Junior year was my last year with you before you retired. We were all pretty sad when you left.</p>

  <p><strong>Aaron:</strong> I miss it more than I expected, honestly. Thirty years in the classroom, and then suddenly you're just… not. It's been an adjustment.</p>

  <p><strong>Jordan:</strong> What have you been doing with yourself?</p>

  <p><strong>Aaron:</strong> Well... staying busy. Lot's of traveling in our RV. I've been writing most nights. Some ministry work I'd been planning for years... Figuring out who I am when I'm not "Mr. Powner" anymore. But enough about me—what about you? You were headed to State, right? Pre-med or something?</p>

  <p><strong>Jordan:</strong> Yeah, that didn't exactly work out. Changed majors twice, took a gap year that turned into two, finally finished with a business degree. Now I'm doing project management for a tech company.</p>

  <p><strong>Aaron:</strong> Hey, that's not nothing. You landed on your feet.</p>

  <p><strong>Jordan:</strong> I guess... Actually… I was kind of hoping I'd run into you sometime.</p>

  <p><strong>Aaron:</strong> Really?</p>

  <p><strong>Jordan:</strong> You always said in class that you couldn't share your religious views at a public school, but that after we graduated, we could ask you anything. I finally get to ask.</p>

  <p><strong>Aaron:</strong> I remember that you were one of the persistent ones, weren't you? Always trying to get me to slip up.</p>

  <p><strong>Jordan:</strong> I was convinced you were a member of my church. The way you talked about families, the way you treated people… I kept looking for clues.</p>

  <p><strong>Aaron:</strong> And I kept telling you—</p>

  <p><strong>Jordan:</strong> You said, "Watch how I live and treat people. Pay attention to what I care about and what upsets me. You can probably figure out what I believe without me saying a word."</p>

  <p><strong>Aaron:</strong> Did you figure it out?</p>

  <p><strong>Jordan:</strong> I had my suspicions. But you never confirmed anything. It drove me crazy.</p>

  <p><strong>Aaron:</strong> Well... You aren't my student anymore. You can ask me anything now.</p>

  <p><strong>Jordan:</strong> I guess I'm not here to ask what church you belong to. I already know the answer to that. I'm here because… I don't know what I believe anymore. And I thought maybe you could help.</p>

  <p><strong>Aaron:</strong> That's a big thing to carry. What's on your mind, Jordan? You look like you're holding very tight to something.</p>

  <p><strong>Jordan:</strong> Can we sit for a minute?</p>

  <p><strong>Aaron:</strong> Of course. Let me grab my lunch. And hey—you can call me Aaron now. I think you've earned it.</p>

  <p><strong>Jordan:</strong> It feels a little strange to call you by your first name. I always saw you as a trusted adult. You're a minister now. What do people call you in that role?</p>

  <p><strong>Aaron:</strong> Some folks I serve and work with call me Brother Aaron.</p>

  <p><strong>Jordan:</strong> Okay, then... Brother Aaron–I hope you can help me. I don't even know how to start. It's going to sound stupid.</p>

  <p><strong>Aaron:</strong> Go ahead. Try me.</p>

  <p><strong>Jordan:</strong> I did most of what I was supposed to do, you know? Finished school. Got a decent job. I'm not rich, but I'm not struggling either. I've got friends, a relationship that's going pretty well. On paper, things are fine. But there's this… I don't know how to describe it.</p>

  <p><strong>Aaron:</strong> It's okay. Take your time with it.</p>

  <p><strong>Jordan:</strong> I am proud of what I've accomplished, but I feel tired. Maybe I'm burnt out. It's like an itch I can't scratch. This feeling that something's missing, even when nothing's actually wrong. Some days I wake up and think, "Is this it? Is this what I worked so hard for? Is this who I'm supposed to be?" And then I feel guilty for even feeling that way, because I know people have it way worse.</p>

  <p><strong>Aaron:</strong> That doesn't sound stupid at all.</p>

  <p><strong>Jordan:</strong> No?</p>

  <p><strong>Aaron:</strong> No. Actually, what you're describing is so common it's almost universal. I've heard versions of it from students, from people I've worked with in ministry, from my own mirror. There's this hunger that most people feel at some point in their lives. We don't all feel it at the same time, and it's not even continuous within an individual's lifetime. Some days it's silent, others it is a full-blown existential crisis. It depends on what's happening in one's life. When we feel it, it's a hunger for something more than just getting by. More than just being comfortable. And the strange thing is, it often shows up strongest when things are going well.</p>

  <p><strong>Jordan:</strong> Why would that be?</p>

  <p><strong>Aaron:</strong> When things are hard, you're mostly too busy surviving to notice the hunger. You're just trying to get through the day. But when the pressure lets up and you finally have room to breathe… that's when you start asking the bigger questions. Who am I? What's this all for? Is there something I'm supposed to be doing that I'm not?</p>

  <p><strong>Jordan:</strong> Yeah. That's exactly it.</p>

  <p><strong>Aaron:</strong> Then you're in good company. That hunger isn't a sign that something's wrong with you. If anything, it's a sign you're paying attention.</p>

  <p><strong>Jordan:</strong> But what am I supposed to do with it? I've tried stuff. I went through a phase where I was really into self-improvement—books, podcasts, the whole thing. Some of it helped for a while. Then I tried getting more serious about fitness, thinking maybe I just needed to feel stronger. That helped too, kind of. But the feeling always comes back.</p>

  <p><strong>Aaron:</strong> It does, doesn't it?</p>

  <p><strong>Jordan:</strong> So what's the answer? More therapy? Meditation? Going back to church? Get a hobby?</p>

  <p><strong>Aaron:</strong> Therapy when you need to work through things is a healthy choice. Going back to church to find a supportive community is a good choice, too. Can I tell you something that might sound strange?</p>

  <p><strong>Jordan:</strong> Sure.</p>

  <p><strong>Aaron:</strong> What if the hunger we all sometimes feel isn't a problem to solve?</p>

  <p><strong>Jordan:</strong> What do you mean?</p>

  <p><strong>Aaron:</strong> I spent a lot of years thinking exactly what you're thinking—that the restlessness was a bug, and my job was to find the fix. The right answer, the right practice, the right doctrines or belief system would finally make it go away. But I've started to see it differently now.</p>

  <p><strong>Jordan:</strong> How so?</p>

  <p><strong>Aaron:</strong> What if the hunger is actually… a feature? What if it's built into us on purpose?</p>

  <p><strong>Jordan:</strong> That sounds like something someone says to make suffering feel meaningful.</p>

  <p><strong>Aaron:</strong> Fair enough. You always were sharp. But think about it from a teaching perspective. You remember what I used to say when you guys got stuck on a lab experiment and wanted me to just give you the answer?</p>

  <p><strong>Jordan:</strong> "The struggle is where the learning happens."</p>

  <p><strong>Aaron:</strong> Drove you crazy, didn't I?</p>

  <p><strong>Jordan:</strong> Little bit, yeah.</p>

  <p><strong>Aaron:</strong> But was I wrong?</p>

  <p><strong>Jordan:</strong> No. The labs where I had to figure it out myself were the ones I actually remembered.</p>

  <p><strong>Aaron:</strong> Right. Because struggle isn't the enemy of growth—it's the mechanism of growth. The discomfort of not knowing, of having to reach for something just beyond your grasp… that's where the transformation happens. What if spiritual growth works the same way?</p>

  <p><strong>Jordan:</strong> So you're saying the restlessness is… productive?</p>

  <p><strong>Aaron:</strong> I'm saying it might be the engine. The thing that keeps us from settling. The thing that keeps us becoming.</p>

  <p><strong>Jordan:</strong> Becoming what?</p>

  <p><strong>Aaron:</strong> <em>That's</em> the question, isn't it?</p>

  <p><strong>Jordan:</strong> Okay, but becoming what? I don't even know what I'm supposed to be aiming at. I've got more questions than answers at this point.</p>

  <p><strong>Aaron:</strong> Good for you!</p>

  <p><strong>Jordan:</strong> Good? How is that good?</p>

  <p><strong>Aaron:</strong> Because questions are how we grow. You remember Socrates?</p>

  <p><strong>Jordan:</strong> Vaguely. Drank poison. Asked too many questions.</p>

  <p><strong>Aaron:</strong> That's the guy. He was onto something, though. The unexamined life and all that. Look, here's what I've learned after a few decades of wrestling with this stuff: the questions don't go away. They're not supposed to.</p>

  <p><strong>Jordan:</strong> Can I ask you something personal?</p>

  <p><strong>Aaron:</strong> Of course.</p>

  <p><strong>Jordan:</strong> Do you ever doubt? Like, really doubt? Or has your faith gotten solid enough that you don't have to deal with that anymore?</p>

  <p><strong>Aaron:</strong> Oh, I have frequent doubts... mostly about myself. I don't doubt God so much anymore. But there are nights I lie awake and wonder if I've got the whole thing wrong. If I've wasted my time and energy to do things that just don't matter.</p>

  <p><strong>Jordan:</strong> Really?</p>

  <p><strong>Aaron:</strong> Really. But here's the thing—those doubts don't scare me the way they used to. They've become part of the process. Part of the curriculum, if you want to use the school metaphor again. I've made a decision to follow Christ whether or not I have perfect understanding, whether or not I fit into any particular tradition's definition of proper belief, you know, creeds and theology. I feel the Lord's peace. I see his influence in my life. And that's enough for me to keep walking, even when I can't see where the path leads.</p>

  <p><strong>Jordan:</strong> Conviction and uncertainty at the same time.</p>

  <p><strong>Aaron:</strong> That's exactly it. They're not opposites. They're companions—just like the questions.</p>

  <p><strong>Jordan:</strong> I don't know what I expected from this conversation. Maybe some kind of answer that would make the restlessness stop.</p>

  <p><strong>Aaron:</strong> And instead?</p>

  <p><strong>Jordan:</strong> Instead I'm starting to think maybe it's not supposed to stop. Maybe the hunger is the point.</p>

  <p><strong>Aaron:</strong> Look at you. You're doing the work.</p>

  <p><strong>Jordan:</strong> There's that teacher talk again.</p>

  <p><strong>Aaron:</strong> I told you, thirty years leaves a mark. But listen—I want you to hear something clearly before we go.</p>

  <p><strong>Jordan:</strong> Okay.</p>

  <p><strong>Aaron:</strong> Wherever you are in this search—just beginning, deep in the middle, tired or angry and ready to give up—the search itself is sacred. The hunger is evidence of your aliveness. The questions are doorways, not walls. And you are not alone in any of it.</p>

  <p><strong>Jordan:</strong> What do you mean?</p>

  <p><strong>Aaron:</strong> I mean there are people all over this world—across every culture, every tradition, every generation—wrestling with the same questions you are. We're all fellow searchers. And in my experience, we find each other along the way. Sometimes in churches, sometimes in food courts, sometimes in the most unexpected places.</p>

  <p><strong>Jordan:</strong> Like running into your old science teacher.</p>

  <p><strong>Aaron:</strong> Exactly like that.</p>

  <p><strong>Jordan:</strong> So what do I do now?</p>

  <p><strong>Aaron:</strong> Keep searching. But maybe search differently than before. Instead of looking for answers that will make the questions stop, look for a way of living that makes the questions bearable—even beautiful. Find people who will search alongside you. And when you stumble—because you will, we all do—remember that the stumbling is part of it. The Refiner is patient. There's always grace for another try.</p>

  <p><strong>Jordan:</strong> Thank you, Brother Aaron. Really.</p>

  <p><strong>Aaron:</strong> Thank you for trusting me with this. One more thing?</p>

  <p><strong>Jordan:</strong> Yeah?</p>

  <p><strong>Aaron:</strong> The fact that you're asking these questions, feeling this hunger, wrestling with what it all means—that's not weakness. It's strength. It's what being a child of God looks like. Don't let anyone—including yourself—convince you otherwise.</p>

  <p><strong>Jordan:</strong> I'll try to remember that.</p>

  <p><strong>Aaron:</strong> And hey—don't be a stranger. This conversation doesn't have to be a one-time thing.</p>

  <p><strong>Jordan:</strong> I'd like that. Good bye, Brother Aaron.</p>

  <p class="reflection"><em><strong>Aaron (reflecting):</strong> Well, I didn't expect to have that conversation today. But then, I rarely expect the moments that end up mattering most.</em></p>

  <p class="reflection"><em>Jordan is still searching. So am I. After all these years—after teaching and writing and ministering and failing and trying again—I'm still on the path to Christ, still feeling the hunger, still asking questions I can't fully answer.</em></p>

  <p class="reflection"><em>Creation is not finished. Neither is Jordan. Neither am I. None of us is finished.</em></p>

  <p class="reflection"><em>And that, I've come to believe, is very good news.</em></p>

  <p class="reflection"><em>I can testify of my confidence in the divinity of this process—in the hunger, in the questions, in the grace that holds us through it all—in the name of Jesus Christ—Amen.</em></p>

<h2 id="section-note-to-the-reader">{% sentence 0 %}Note to the Reader{% endsentence %}</h2>

{% sentence 1 %}This chapter will feel unconventional compared to other chapters within our Words of Plainness writings.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 2 %}What follows is not a chapter that has "arrived at" conclusions.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 3 %}It is a demonstration of the nature of "Our Search" in action, focused on the personal growth of Aaron, the primary writer.{% endsentence %}

{% sentence 4 %}I, Aaron, first wrote about the most important life questions we all seek to answer—the subject of chapter two—more than two decades ago, when I was in my early thirties.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 5 %}I was just beginning my teaching career and my children were very young.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 6 %}My brother, in his forties, had traveled somewhat further down a similar career path, but we lived on opposite ends of the country.{% endsentence %}

{% sentence 7 %}In those days of writing alone, I had already been ministering the gospel of Jesus Christ for more than fifteen years.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 8 %}I had genuine conviction then, and much of what I wrote still rings true.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 9 %}But the "refiner's fire" described in Malachi has shaped and molded my understanding and sensibilities.{% endsentence %}

{% sentence 10 %}More than two decades of maturing ministry, interfaith dialogue, teaching high school sciences, and the unique crucible of ordinary living and raising a family within evolving communities have all done their work on my soul.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 11 %}Some of my earlier certainties have been tempered.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 12 %}Others have deepened in unexpected ways.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 13 %}Now, in my fifth decade of life, I recognize a significant softening of my ego, making room for a compassion—empathy even—that feels less like a choice and more like a reflex.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 14 %}This character trait has finally settled into my bones, becoming a visceral recognition that my own spiritual growth is bearing the "fruits of the Spirit.".{% endsentence %}

{% sentence 15 %}Rather than erase my earlier voice or pretend that I have arrived at final answers at this stage of my life, we have chosen to present both: the questions as I framed them then, and the spiritual wrestling I continue with now.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 16 %}You will encounter my younger voice—from my thirties—in regular text, and my current voice—now in my fifties—following each section.{% endsentence %}

{% sentence 17 %}I do this because "Our Search" is the point of this chapter.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 18 %}Some refer to this "Search" as their spiritual "Journey" or "Path." It is not easy or comfortable to grow spiritually.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 19 %}This is illustrated beautifully from the life story of the prophet Enos in the Book of Mormon, who wrote, "I will tell you of the wrestle which I had before God," for "my soul hungered.".{% endsentence %}

{% sentence 20 %}If these Words of Plainness presented only firm conclusions as final declarations of truth, they would betray their subject.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 21 %}The hunger we share—for meaning, for truth, for something substantial enough to stake our lives on—is not a problem to solve in a single go.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 22 %}This personal searching and striving is not a "One and Done" experience.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 23 %}It is a necessary, ongoing tension to live within.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 24 %}The traditions that sustain people do not offer final answers but livable frameworks.{% endsentence %}

{% sentence 25 %}Your spiritual journey is your own.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 26 %}I will not hijack it.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 27 %}My hope is only that seeing one person's search across time—with its clarifications, revisions, and enduring convictions—might give you permission, and a sense of companionship, to pursue your own search.{% endsentence %}

{% sentence 28 %}We are fellow searchers.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 29 %}Let us begin.{% endsentence %}

<h2 id="section-thesis-1-the-hunger-within">{% sentence 30 %}Thesis 1: The Hunger Within{% endsentence %}</h2>

<h3 id="section-earlier-1">{% sentence 31 %}From My Earlier Writings{% endsentence %}</h3>

{% sentence 32 %}Central to the human experience is a profound hunger for greater understanding, a nobler purpose, and enduring satisfaction with life.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 33 %}Tragically, the noise and worries of daily living often deafen us to this yearning.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 34 %}Yet as we experience life, many of us eventually awake to the realization that selfish pursuits and common pleasures are ultimately unsatisfying.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 35 %}We deeply need more than these can offer.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 36 %}To the searching and discontented soul there seems to be a famine of truly meaningful experiences in the world, a drought of something substantial to satisfy the driving thirst of the human heart.{% endsentence %}

{% sentence 37 %}We all occasionally feel that something is not quite right with life, even when things are going well—as if something is missing.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 38 %}This can become a mournful itch that we do not know how to scratch.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 39 %}Have you ever felt like there is more goodness and nobility inside you than is apparent?{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 40 %}Have you ever felt longings, like homesickness, without any explanation?{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 41 %}These longings are a normal and healthy part of the human experience.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 42 %}There are times in our lives when we become especially thoughtful, and we think about the nature of our existence.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 43 %}There are as many reasons to contemplate life as there are people.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 44 %}Many devote much energy and time to the search for truth and meaning.{% endsentence %}

{% sentence 45 %}The most basic reason to improve our understanding is for simple survival.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 46 %}Many of us feel driven to learn and explore by curiosity or even boredom.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 47 %}Some seek to lessen pain resulting from a traumatic experience or loss, while others fear death.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 48 %}Many of us seek for something more authentic, some meaningful and lasting cause for which to hope or to work.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 49 %}Others may feel empty or lost in life; whatever the reason may be, the desire connected with these thoughtful moments is to gain more perspective on life.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 50 %}We need to define our place in the world, as we all eventually hunger and thirst to live each day with greater purpose and satisfaction.{% endsentence %}

<h3 id="section-later-1">{% sentence 51 %}Twenty-Plus Years Later{% endsentence %}</h3>

{% sentence 52 %}Reading these words now, I am struck by what I got right and what I had not yet learned to see.{% endsentence %}

{% sentence 53 %}The hunger is real.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 54 %}I would not soften that claim.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 55 %}After decades of teaching, ministering, and living alongside people from vastly different backgrounds—atheists and believers, scientists and mystics, the wounded and the thriving—I have found this hunger to be universal.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 56 %}That we exist is something we can agree upon.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 57 %}Why we exist is the subject of much debate and passion.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 58 %}What we do with existence defines our character and sense of identity.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 59 %}These three facts form common ground for every searching soul.{% endsentence %}

{% sentence 60 %}What I would add now is this: the hunger itself is not a sign that something is wrong with us.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 61 %}It is evidence that we are awakening spiritually.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 62 %}Those who feel no such hunger may have numbed themselves to it, or they may have found worldview frameworks that satisfy them, at least for a season.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 63 %}Both possibilities deserve respectful tolerance.{% endsentence %}

{% sentence 64 %}I have also come to appreciate a truth my younger self was circling but had not quite grasped: the living traditions that sustain people tend to offer not final answers but an imperfect, incomplete collection of coping skills for survival.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 65 %}This spiritual hunger does not disappear when we find faith or a portion of truth.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 66 %}It transforms.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 67 %}It becomes anticipation rather than anguish.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 68 %}I feel a pleasant sense of "something more" approaching, a developmental shift I cannot fully name but will welcome when I recognize its arrival.{% endsentence %}

{% sentence 69 %}If you recognize this hunger in yourself, know that it is neither weakness nor failure.{% endsentence %}

<h2 id="section-thesis-2-questions-that-demand-answers">Thesis 2: Questions That Demand Answers</h2>

{% sentence 70 %}It is the evidence of your "aliveness."{% endsentence %}

<h3 id="section-earlier-2">{% sentence 71 %}From My Earlier Writings{% endsentence %}</h3>

{% sentence 72 %}As we search for understanding, we naturally wonder about life's purpose and question the wisdom we've inherited.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 73 %}Many traditions teach that we are born to die, yet we must die to truly live.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 74 %}Mortals live only for a time and then die.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 75 %}Mortality is the limited span of this life, while immortality is eternal life.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 76 %}As seeds of God, we seem to barely have time to take root and blossom in the gardens of mortality.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 77 %}It also seems that we might only mature to bear the fruits of immortality long after our mortal journey ends.{% endsentence %}

{% sentence 78 %}There are many more immediate concerns than our fear of death and hopes for immortality.{% endsentence %}

{% sentence 79 %}Consider these fundamental questions: Who am I?{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 80 %}Why am I?{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 81 %}What can I become?{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 82 %}What is happiness, and how do we find it in this life?{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 83 %}Do good and evil really exist as objective realities?{% endsentence %}

<h3 id="section-later-2">{% sentence 88 %}Twenty-Plus Years Later{% endsentence %}</h3>

{% sentence 89 %}These questions still matter.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 90 %}But in recent years, I have found a simpler way to organize them—one that emerged, unexpectedly, through dialogue with an artificial intelligence and refinement in numerous interfaith chats on virtual reality social platforms.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 91 %}When I asked "What questions feel most essential for people to answer so that they can feel like things are okay?" The volume of responses clarified what I had been perceiving for decades.{% endsentence %}

{% sentence 92 %}First, identity and worth: Who am I, and do I matter?{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 93 %}We need assurance that our existence has significance—that we are not merely interchangeable or accidental.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 94 %}Second, meaning and purpose: What am I here for?{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 95 %}Most people need to feel their days add up to something—that their effort and suffering are not arbitrary.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 96 %}Third, connection and belonging: Am I known, and do I belong somewhere?{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 97 %}Loneliness is not just uncomfortable; it is existentially destabilizing.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 98 %}Fourth, goodness and moral orientation: What is right, and can I live it?{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 99 %}Moral confusion creates deep anxiety and spiritual unrest.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 100 %}Fifth, suffering and coherence: Why do bad things happen, and can I bear them?{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 101 %}We can endure remarkable hardship if it fits into a coherent story.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 102 %}And sixth, death and continuity: What happens when I die, and does anything last?{% endsentence %}

{% sentence 103 %}What strikes me is that these are not puzzles to solve only once—they are divinely created existential tensions to live within.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 104 %}I no longer expect to arrive at answers that silence the questions.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 105 %}Instead, I have learned to dwell within them, letting the questions themselves become companions on the journey.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 106 %}Perhaps this is what spiritual maturity looks like: not the accumulation of certainties, but the capacity to hold uncertainty without despair.{% endsentence %}

<h2 id="section-thesis-3-how-we-cope">{% sentence 107 %}Thesis 3: How We Cope{% endsentence %}</h2>

<h3 id="section-earlier-3">{% sentence 108 %}From My Earlier Writings{% endsentence %}</h3>

{% sentence 109 %}To satisfy our hunger for truth, meaning, and lasting happiness, we must pursue them directly and honestly.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 110 %}Unfortunately, many of us cope with such hunger by substituting temporary distractions in its place.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 111 %}We have observed several such coping mechanisms in ourselves and in others, including pride, despair, rebellion, submission, and self-justification.{% endsentence %}

{% sentence 112 %}<strong>Pride.</strong>{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 113 %}Competition is a natural part of the human experience.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 114 %}It can be very healthy when combined with wisdom and civility.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 115 %}However, when competition is adopted as the meaning of life, all there is to one's existence is the survival of ego and the pursuit of power, position, and fame.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 116 %}Such competition is a vain attempt to create meaning where none can exist for long.{% endsentence %}

{% sentence 117 %}<strong>Despair.</strong>{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 118 %}A sorrowful way to deal with life is to actively refuse to cope.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 119 %}Some have been overwhelmed by the search for truth to such a degree that they feel confused, frustrated, or even scared—losing hope in ever understanding life.{% endsentence %}

{% sentence 120 %}<strong>Rebellion.</strong>{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 121 %}Some cope by resisting authority or authoritative ideas.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 122 %}While it is healthy to consider ideas independently, many categorically reject traditional wisdom.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 123 %}Rebellion often arises as a response to traumatic or confusing experiences and becomes a defense mechanism rooted in mistrust.{% endsentence %}

{% sentence 124 %}<strong>Submission.</strong>{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 125 %}There is wisdom in carefully evaluating long-held traditions.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 126 %}However, we refer here to those who embrace authority without question or careful thought.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 127 %}Some distrust their own judgment, preferring to be told what to believe.{% endsentence %}

{% sentence 128 %}<strong>Self-Justification.</strong>{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 129 %}We often go to great lengths to excuse our thoughts, feelings, and actions.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 130 %}Many seek self-justification by embracing philosophical systems that validate their choices.{% endsentence %}

<h3 id="section-later-3">{% sentence 131 %}Twenty-Plus Years Later{% endsentence %}</h3>

{% sentence 132 %}This section troubled me significantly when I reread it in my fifties.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 133 %}Not because I think the categories are wrong.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 134 %}Pride, despair, rebellion, submission, and self-justification do describe real patterns I see in myself and others.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 135 %}What troubles me is the tone of certainty from my early decades.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 136 %}My younger voice named these distractions as "false substitutes for truth," which implies judgment.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 137 %}It suggests that people who cope this way are making a choice to avoid truth when they could simply choose otherwise.{% endsentence %}

{% sentence 138 %}What I have learned in the last twenty years of teaching, ministry, and simply paying attention is this: most people are doing the best they know how.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 139 %}They live with a mixture of strengths and weaknesses, shaped by their unique backstories and formative experiences.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 140 %}Each person possesses a unique blend of incomplete coping skills, uncertain resources, and shifting social structures.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 141 %}Each of us is also possessed of attitudes and worldviews that might or might not be adaptive to the needs of life.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 142 %}No one is completely evil.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 143 %}No one is completely good.{% endsentence %}

{% sentence 144 %}The person who retreats into pride may have learned early that vulnerability invites harm.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 145 %}The person who sinks into despair may have been genuinely overwhelmed by losses no one should have to bear alone.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 146 %}The rebel may have been burned by authorities who violated sacred trust.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 147 %}The one who submits may have never been given permission to think their own thoughts.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 148 %}The self-justifier may be carrying shame so heavy that facing it directly would break them.{% endsentence %}

{% sentence 149 %}These are not failures of will.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 150 %}They are survival strategies, bookmarks of safety in our story of healing and progress.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 151 %}They deserve compassion, not condemnation.{% endsentence %}

{% sentence 152 %}This does not mean we should remain in patterns that harm ourselves or others.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 153 %}Growth is possible.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 154 %}I have witnessed it literally thousands of times in my students, and experienced it myself.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 155 %}But growth rarely comes through being told we are doing it wrong.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 156 %}It comes through being met with understanding, being offered better tools, and being invited into communities that hold space for both our wounds and our healing growth.{% endsentence %}

{% sentence 157 %}If you recognize yourself in any of these patterns, please hear me: you are not broken.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 158 %}You are surviving.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 159 %}And surviving is the first step toward thriving.{% endsentence %}

<h2 id="section-thesis-4-the-path-forward">{% sentence 160 %}Thesis 4: The Path Forward{% endsentence %}</h2>

<h3 id="section-earlier-4">{% sentence 161 %}From My Earlier Writings{% endsentence %}</h3>

{% sentence 162 %}All of these coping mechanisms can become artificial substitutes for the genuine discovery of truth, wisdom, and happiness.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 163 %}We must pause to evaluate ourselves periodically.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 164 %}Embracing extremes of pride, despair, rebellion, and submission can cripple the soul.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 165 %}Wisdom lies in avoiding extremes and finding the balanced middle path.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 166 %}For example, humility is in the balance between pride and despair.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 167 %}Another example would be independent judgment, which lies in the balance between rebellion and blind submission.{% endsentence %}

{% sentence 168 %}We invite you to embrace the search with honest humility.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 169 %}Even when we grasp important truths, vast understanding still awaits discovery.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 170 %}We assure you that truth is knowable, and enduring happiness can be found in this life.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 171 %}Renew your search with courage and hope, remembering the promise: "Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find." "Our search" is worth any sacrifice.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 172 %}These things we testify in the name of Jesus Christ, Amen.{% endsentence %}

<h3 id="section-later-4">{% sentence 173 %}Twenty-Plus Years Later{% endsentence %}</h3>

{% sentence 174 %}The balance my younger self described is real: humility between pride and despair, independent judgment between rebellion and submission.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 175 %}This principle has guided my life and I still teach it.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 176 %}My thousands of students will recognize—and probably roll their eyes with a smile at—the numerous repetitions of my personal catchphrase: "Truth, health, and wisdom are usually somewhere in the middle of extremes." My teaching style was to require the application of this principle in the science classroom and laboratory as I helped young minds understand natural principles, like: dynamic equilibrium in physical science, homeostasis in biology, and sustainability in environmental science.{% endsentence %}

{% sentence 177 %}What I would now add to this chapter is that finding balance in spiritual development is not a destination but a practice.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 178 %}For example, we do not arrive at humility and then possess it forever.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 179 %}We practice humility, daily, in the face of our recurring temptations toward either pride or despair.{% endsentence %}

{% sentence 180 %}The opposition in all things—whether viewed as wisdom in science or spirituality—is the tension between what we are and what we might become.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 181 %}This dynamic tension is woven into the structure of existence itself.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 182 %}It is not an obstacle to development but the very means of growth.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 183 %}I now see mortality as a learning experience for our spirits.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 184 %}And the Creator—the Master Teacher—wrote these conditions of opposition as the curriculum of our mortal education.{% endsentence %}

{% sentence 185 %}I still believe what I wrote decades ago: truth is knowable.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 186 %}Enduring happiness can be found.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 187 %}Ask, and it shall be given.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 188 %}Seek, and you shall find.{% endsentence %}

{% sentence 189 %}But I have also learned that asking and seeking look different than I once imagined.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 190 %}They are less like solving a puzzle and more like cultivating a relationship.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 191 %}They require patience, humility, and the willingness to be surprised—even by the source of the answers.{% endsentence %}

{% sentence 192 %}Another personal milestone has been settling into a humble confidence in God—one that doesn't depend on having final answers to life's important questions.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 193 %}I have become less concerned about formalized creeds and official doctrines, though they are still a source of puzzling fascination to me.{% endsentence %}

{% sentence 194 %}With or without perfect understanding of "correct" theology, I have accepted Jesus Christ as my divine and living Savior.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 195 %}Whether or not others approve, I will follow Him.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 196 %}I feel His peace.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 197 %}I perceive God's power and Spirit operating in my life.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 198 %}Whether I am accepted by particular traditions or philosophies has no bearing on my view of their adherents as fellow children of God, for I see them as brothers and sisters, fellow searchers.{% endsentence %}

<h2 id="section-the-gift-of-holy-dissatisfaction">{% sentence 199 %}The Gift of Holy Dissatisfaction{% endsentence %}</h2>

{% sentence 200 %}There is something I did not understand when I first wrote about the hunger within us.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 201 %}I described it accurately—the restless longing, the sense that something is missing even when things are going well, the itch we cannot scratch.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 202 %}But I did not yet see it for what it truly is.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 203 %}It is a divine gift and an essential component of a plan based on divine wisdom that is beyond our own.{% endsentence %}

{% sentence 204 %}Consider: God created us with moral agency—the capacity to choose.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 205 %}He placed us in mortal conditions of opposition in all things—light and dark, pleasure and pain, growth and decay.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 206 %}These are well-established principles of both the gospel and science.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 207 %}But there is a companion gift to agency that I had not fully appreciated: The Creator also made us unable to remain satisfied for long with any level of accomplishment or personal development.{% endsentence %}

{% sentence 208 %}This is not a curse.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 209 %}This is not evidence that we are broken or ungrateful or missing the point.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 210 %}It is the deliberate design of a wise God who is the literal parent of our spirits—the divine pedagogy of a divine teacher.{% endsentence %}

{% sentence 211 %}"Blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness: for they shall be filled." Why would a loving Creator build restlessness into our souls? Because creation is not yet finished.{% endsentence %}

{% sentence 212 %}We are still being created—shaped, refined, and polished.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 213 %}The process that began before mortality does not conclude in mortality.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 214 %}We will continue to develop eternally.{% endsentence %}

{% sentence 215 %}If we could reach a point of complete satisfaction—a state where we felt no pull toward growth, no hunger for more light and truth—we would stop becoming what we are meant to become.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 216 %}The restlessness is not a flaw.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 217 %}It is the engine of eternal progression.{% endsentence %}

<h2 id="section-the-safety-net-of-grace">{% sentence 218 %}The Safety Net of Grace{% endsentence %}</h2>

{% sentence 219 %}But here is where the good news of Jesus Christ becomes essential.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 220 %}If we are perpetually stretched toward growth, perpetually placed in conditions of opposition, perpetually invited to exercise agency in a world designed to challenge us, then we will inevitably make mistakes and eventually be held accountable.{% endsentence %}

{% sentence 221 %}This is not pessimism.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 222 %}It is the nature of an educational environment where the curriculum requires risk, choice, and the possibility of failure.{% endsentence %}

{% sentence 223 %}The good news is that we can recover from mistakes.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 224 %}Through the grace of Christ's atonement, we can recover and grow.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 225 %}He has promised never to give up on us.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 226 %}The prophet Malachi described Him as one who would "sit as a refiner and purifier of silver." The Lord patiently, attentively, watches us over the refining fire until the impurities are drawn out and His own image can be seen reflected in us.{% endsentence %}

{% sentence 227 %}This divine transformation—named in various traditions as sanctification, theosis, purification, insight, discipleship, consecration, holy anointing, and more—happens through the power of the Holy Ghost, the Spirit of Truth.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 228 %}It is not instantaneous.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 229 %}It is not comfortable.{% endsentence %}

{% sentence 230 %}And it is not completed in this life; it continues beyond the veil of death.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 231 %}The resurrection is not the end of development; it is the next phase.{% endsentence %}

<h2 id="section-god-loves-broken-things">{% sentence 232 %}God Loves Broken Things{% endsentence %}</h2>

{% sentence 233 %}I admire a musical testimony by Kenneth Cope.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 234 %}He captured something essential in his song "Broken." He writes that broken clouds give rain, broken soil grows grain, broken bread feeds us for one more day.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 235 %}Broken storms yield light.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 236 %}The break of day heals night.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 237 %}Broken pride turns blindness into sight.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 238 %}The refrain is simple and profound: God loves broken things.{% endsentence %}

{% sentence 239 %}The lyrics help me as I attempt to explain my own awakening to this principle.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 240 %}For years I had thought of brokenness as the problem and Christ as the solution—as if the goal were to be fixed and then remain unbroken.{% endsentence %}

{% sentence 241 %}But the pattern of creation itself suggests otherwise.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 242 %}Seeds must break open to grow.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 243 %}Bread must be broken to nourish.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 244 %}Hearts must be broken to become capable of deeper love.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 245 %}The most holy of sacrifices we can give to God is a "broken spirit: a broken and a contrite heart" (Psalm 51:17, 3 Nephi 9:20).{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 246 %}This, He can work with.{% endsentence %}

{% sentence 247 %}The hunger we feel, the dissatisfaction with any resting place, the holy restlessness that drives us forward—this is the breaking that makes growth possible.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 248 %}Christ does not stand at the end of the process, waiting to congratulate us when we finally get it right.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 249 %}He walks with us through every breaking—every reformation—every new becoming.{% endsentence %}

{% sentence 250 %}"He will sit as a refiner." Not standing apart.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 251 %}Sitting.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 252 %}Attentive.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 253 %}Present.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 254 %}Patient.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 255 %}Participating.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 256 %}Masterful.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 257 %}Watching until the work is done—and the work is never done, because we are eternal beings with infinite potential.{% endsentence %}

<h2 id="section-the-invitation">{% sentence 258 %}The Invitation{% endsentence %}</h2>

{% sentence 259 %}So when you feel the hunger return after accomplishing something meaningful and find yourself quickly restless for more, do not interpret this as failure.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 260 %}Do not assume you missed something or chose the wrong path.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 261 %}This restlessness is a gift.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 262 %}It is the voice of your eternal nature refusing to settle for less than what you are capable of becoming.{% endsentence %}

{% sentence 263 %}And when you stumble, when you make mistakes in this mortal educational environment—as all of us do—know that the Refiner sits beside his holy fire, watching, waiting, ready to continue the work whenever you willingly return to Him.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 264 %}He has promised not to give up on us.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 265 %}The process of sanctification does not conclude in this mortal life.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 266 %}There is eternity.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 267 %}There is grace.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 268 %}There is always another invitation to move forward.{% endsentence %}

{% sentence 269 %}Creation is not finished.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 270 %}Neither are you.{% endsentence %}

{% sentence 274 %}I do not know where you are in your search.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 275 %}Perhaps you are just beginning—overwhelmed by questions that seem to have no answers.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 276 %}Perhaps you are deep in the middle—having found some things but still hungry for more.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 277 %}Perhaps you have wandered for years and are tired—or even angry.{% endsentence %}

{% sentence 278 %}Wherever you are, know this: the search itself is meaningful.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 279 %}The hunger you feel is evidence of your aliveness.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 280 %}The questions that haunt you are invitations, not accusations.{% endsentence %}

{% sentence 281 %}I have not arrived at my final destination.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 282 %}Neither, I suspect, have you.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 283 %}But we are on our way, together.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 284 %}And perhaps that is enough.{% endsentence %}

{% sentence 285 %}Here is what I am still discovering: That compassion for others begins with compassion for myself.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 286 %}That conviction and humility can coexist.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 287 %}That the Creator's wisdom can be read in the Creation if we have eyes to see.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 288 %}That unexpected conversation partners—even virtual or artificial ones—can illuminate what we have long sensed but not yet named. What are you discovering? Our search continues along the straight and narrow path.{% endsentence %}
