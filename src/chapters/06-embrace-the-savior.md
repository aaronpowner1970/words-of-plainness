podcastTranscript: |
  <p><strong>Host:</strong> Welcome back to the Words of Plainness podcast overview series. I'm here with Brother Aaron Powner, and today we're walking through Chapter 6 of the book — "Embrace the Savior." Aaron, welcome.</p>
  <p><strong>Aaron:</strong> Thank you. Glad to be here.</p>
  <p><strong>Host:</strong> So, I have to say — this chapter surprised me. I opened it expecting what you'd expect from a chapter about faith in Jesus Christ. And the first thing I see is a poem. Or, I guess — a chorus?</p>
  <p><strong>Aaron:</strong> A Discipleship Chorus, yeah. It's structured in four movements. And it's not just decorative — it's actually the heartbeat of the whole chapter. Each movement maps to a stage of what happens when someone genuinely embraces the Savior.</p>
  <p><strong>Host:</strong> Walk me through that. Because I'll be honest, on first read I almost skimmed past it to get to the "real content." And then I realized — that was the content.</p>
  <p><strong>Aaron:</strong> Right. And I think that's how faith works for a lot of people, actually. We rush past the experience trying to get to the explanation. But the chorus is meant to be felt first. Then the chapter unpacks what you just felt.</p>
  <p><strong>Host:</strong> Okay, so let's take them one at a time. The first movement is called "The Reception." And the line is — "I have tasted the Light, Grace of the Living Son of God, and my heart is full." What does that represent?</p>
  <p><strong>Aaron:</strong> That's the moment of first contact. You've been searching — honestly searching — and something breaks through. A warmth in your heart. A clarity you can't manufacture on your own. The chapter sets this up by reminding the reader of everything they've already walked through in the book — prayer, questions about existence, the limits of human knowledge — and then it asks this very direct question: Has the seed begun to swell within you?</p>
  <p><strong>Host:</strong> And that seed language — that's from Alma in the Book of Mormon?</p>
  <p><strong>Aaron:</strong> Alma chapter 32, yes. He compares the word of God to a seed, and he says if it's real, it will swell and become delicious to you. So "The Reception" is about recognizing that moment — you tasted something. You don't have all the answers yet, but something real has happened inside you.</p>
  <p><strong>Host:</strong> I like that it says "my heart is full" — not "my mind is convinced."</p>
  <p><strong>Aaron:</strong> Exactly. And that's deliberate. Faith isn't first an intellectual conclusion. It begins as an experience. The chapter makes a pretty sharp distinction early on — it says the devils also believe. Satan knows God is real. That knowledge brings him nothing but misery. So belief alone, just raw intellectual acknowledgment, isn't what saves anyone. What separates saving faith from the belief of devils is surrender, trust, and willingness to be changed. "The Reception" is that first taste — not yet the full meal, but enough to know something real is on the table.</p>
  <p><strong>Host:</strong> All right. Movement two. "The Transformation." "His truth rises in me like the morning sun, and it calls me to move." Now we're getting somewhere.</p>
  <p><strong>Aaron:</strong> Now you're being changed. And the chapter covers this under the heading "Born Again" — which, by the way, is not just a phrase people throw around at revivals. Jesus said it plainly: unless you're born again, you can't see the kingdom of God. And the chapter treats that seriously. It's not self-improvement. It's not turning over a new leaf with your own willpower. It's a transformation of the whole soul by the power of God.</p>
  <p><strong>Host:</strong> The chapter has this beautiful line about how for some people the new birth arrives like lightning, and for others it comes like dawn — so gradually you can't name the exact moment the light became unmistakable.</p>
  <p><strong>Aaron:</strong> And then it says: both are real. Which I think matters a lot, because people sometimes disqualify their own spiritual experiences because they didn't have some dramatic, cinematic moment. The chapter says no — what matters is whether the tree is growing, not how dramatically the seed first sprouted.</p>
  <p><strong>Host:</strong> That's a generous way to put it. And I notice the chorus says "it calls me to move" — not "it makes me feel warm and fuzzy."</p>
  <p><strong>Aaron:</strong> Right. Faith is not passive. Joseph Smith taught that faith is the principle of action — the moving cause of all action, actually. So if you've genuinely been transformed, you don't just sit there basking in it. Something stirs in you. You want to move. You want to respond. That's "The Transformation" — the morning sun rises, and you can't stay in bed.</p>
  <p><strong>Host:</strong> [laughs] Well, some of us try.</p>
  <p><strong>Aaron:</strong> [laughs] Oh, we all try. But the sun doesn't stop rising just because you pulled the covers up.</p>
  <p><strong>Host:</strong> Fair enough. Okay, movement three — and this one feels like the weightiest. "The Consecration." "I will dance before the Lord with all the life He's given me. I'll use these hands to bear His light." That's a big shift from receiving to giving.</p>
  <p><strong>Aaron:</strong> It is. And the chapter builds to this through two sections that I think people need to sit with. The first is on surrender. The world teaches that surrender is weakness — to yield is to lose, to submit is to be conquered. But the chapter flips that entirely. Surrender to Christ is victory. It's the only true freedom. The chains we thought were holding us together were actually holding us down.</p>
  <p><strong>Host:</strong> That's a line that might sting a little for some people.</p>
  <p><strong>Aaron:</strong> It should, gently. Because most of us have spent a lot of energy trying to control our own lives, protect ourselves, keep everything managed. And the chapter says — that control you thought was protecting you? It was imprisoning you. When you actually let go and fall into His arms, you discover He wasn't waiting to diminish you. He was waiting to enlarge you.</p>
  <p><strong>Host:</strong> And then there's the section on grace.</p>
  <p><strong>Aaron:</strong> Yes. And this is where the chapter addresses something that has divided Christians for centuries — are we saved by grace or by works? And the answer the chapter gives is: yes. Both.</p>
  <p><strong>Host:</strong> [laughs] That's very Latter-day Saint of you.</p>
  <p><strong>Aaron:</strong> [laughs] Maybe. But the logic is sound, I think. Grace is God reaching toward us, unearned and freely offered. But grace that is truly received changes you. It doesn't leave you where it found you. The chapter uses this image of a tree — a tree that has been made alive will bear fruit. Not to prove it deserves sunlight, but because that's what living trees do with light.</p>
  <p><strong>Host:</strong> So the works aren't the payment. They're the evidence.</p>
  <p><strong>Aaron:</strong> The fruit. The natural outgrowth. And that's what "The Consecration" is about. Once you've tasted the Light and been transformed by it, your hands want to work. Your feet want to move. You dance before the Lord — that's not grim duty. That's overflow. That's a heart so full it can't hold still.</p>
  <p><strong>Host:</strong> There's real joy in that image. It's not the picture a lot of people have of religious obligation.</p>
  <p><strong>Aaron:</strong> No, and I think that's part of the point. The chapter says the joy of serving Him is not a grim duty fulfilled — it's the delight of a heart that has found its home, hands that have found their purpose, feet that cannot be still. That's consecration. You're not paying God back. You're becoming the kind of person who can't stop pouring out what's been poured in.</p>
  <p><strong>Host:</strong> And that naturally leads into the chapter's section on fellowship and testimony, doesn't it?</p>
  <p><strong>Aaron:</strong> It does. Because consecration doesn't happen in a vacuum. The chapter is pretty direct on this — faith is personal, but it's not private. God gathers His followers into communities. We need other people. We need correction, instruction, shared burdens.</p>
  <p><strong>Host:</strong> And there's a line in there that had some real teeth to it — something about finding an audience instead of a family?</p>
  <p><strong>Aaron:</strong> [laughs] Yes. "If no one in your fellowship ever challenges you, you may have found an audience, not a family." That's meant to provoke a little self-examination. Because it's tempting to find a congregation that only affirms what you already want to hear. But the body of Christ is supposed to be a family, and families speak uncomfortable truth to each other sometimes.</p>
  <p><strong>Host:</strong> Okay. Final movement. "The Testimony." "Now I'm reborn. Now I'm free." Short. Direct.</p>
  <p><strong>Aaron:</strong> And that's the point. A testimony doesn't have to be long or sophisticated. The chapter uses the example of the woman at the well — she'd lived a complicated life. Five husbands. The man she was with wasn't her husband. And when she encountered Christ, she didn't go home and write a theological paper. She didn't wait until her life was cleaned up and presentable. She dropped her waterpot and ran to the city and said, "Come, see a man who told me all things that I ever did — is not this the Christ?"</p>
  <p><strong>Host:</strong> She just said, come and see.</p>
  <p><strong>Aaron:</strong> That's testimony. It's not an argument. It's not proof designed to compel agreement. It's witness. Here's what happened to me. Here's what changed. Come and see for yourself. And the chapter says no one can argue with your experience. They can only hear it and feel the Spirit confirm or deny its truth in their own hearts.</p>
  <p><strong>Host:</strong> And then the chapter doesn't shy away from the hard part — what happens when faith gets tested. When the light dims.</p>
  <p><strong>Aaron:</strong> No, it doesn't. And I appreciate that honesty. Because everyone who has ever exercised faith has had seasons of doubt or darkness. The chapter makes this important distinction: doubt is not the opposite of faith. Fear and despair is. Doubt that keeps seeking is — and I love this line — "faith wearing different clothes."</p>
  <p><strong>Host:</strong> That's a gift of a line for anyone in a dark season.</p>
  <p><strong>Aaron:</strong> And the Lord's own counsel to Oliver Cowdery in Doctrine and Covenants section 6 is the anchor. He says, in essence, "Remember the night you prayed and I spoke peace to your mind? What greater witness can you have than from God?" The chapter tells the reader — you've felt it before. The seed has swelled. The light has tasted sweet. Return to that memory. Let it hold you until the sun rises again.</p>
  <p><strong>Host:</strong> So the four movements of the chorus — Reception, Transformation, Consecration, Testimony — they're not just stages. They're a cycle you keep living.</p>
  <p><strong>Aaron:</strong> That's a beautiful way to put it, and I think you're right. You taste the Light. It transforms you. You consecrate your life. You bear testimony of what happened. And then, inevitably, you'll be tested — and you return to the wellspring and taste again. And each time through, the roots go deeper.</p>
  <p><strong>Host:</strong> The chapter closes with what it calls "The Invitation" — Come unto Him, Learn of Him, Believe in Him, Follow Him, Remember Him — and a promise.</p>
  <p><strong>Aaron:</strong> A promise made in the name of Jesus Christ. That if you do these things, your faith will be made unshakable by the power of the Spirit of God. "Then shall thy confidence wax strong in the presence of God." You'll move from belief to knowledge. You'll know — not hope, not guess — know that Jesus Christ is the Son of God. And that embracing Him is not loss but gain, not bondage but freedom, not the end of the journey but its true beginning.</p>
  <p><strong>Host:</strong> Now I'm reborn. Now I'm free.</p>
  <p><strong>Aaron:</strong> Amen.</p>
  <p><strong>Host:</strong> Aaron, thank you. That's Chapter 6 — "Embrace the Savior." You can read the full chapter at words-of-plainness.vercel.app. We'll see you next time.</p>

  <p class="section"><strong>[Opening]</strong></p>
  <p class="verse">I was standing at the edge of something<br>
  When the questions finally stopped<br>
  And the silence wasn't empty<br>
  It was full of what I'd lost</p>
  <p class="verse">I had nothing left to offer<br>
  But a willingness to fall<br>
  And the arms that caught me whispered:<br>
  "Child—this is what I made you for"</p>
  <p class="section"><strong>[Verse 1]</strong></p>
  <p class="verse">I used to think that faith meant certainty<br>
  That knowing was enough<br>
  But even demons believe in Him<br>
  And they tremble at the truth</p>
  <p class="verse">It wasn't facts that finally freed me<br>
  It was falling to my knees<br>
  It was opening these hands I'd clenched so tight<br>
  And letting myself breathe</p>
  <p class="section"><strong>[Pre-Chorus]</strong></p>
  <p class="verse">What I thought was strength was prison<br>
  What I thought was loss is gain<br>
  Every wall I built for safety<br>
  Was the architecture of my chains</p>
  <p class="section"><strong>[Chorus 1]</strong></p>
  <p class="chorus">I have tasted the Light<br>
  Grace of the Living Son of God<br>
  And my heart is full, my heart is full</p>
  <p class="chorus">His truth rises within me like the morning sun<br>
  And it calls me to move<br>
  Oh, it calls me to move</p>
  <p class="chorus">I will dance before the Lord<br>
  With all the life He's given me<br>
  I'll use these hands to bear His light</p>
  <p class="chorus">Now I'm reborn<br>
  Now I'm free</p>
  <p class="section"><strong>[Verse 2]</strong></p>
  <p class="verse">The world looks just the same this morning<br>
  But I swear these eyes are new<br>
  Something ancient woke inside me<br>
  Something deathless, something true</p>
  <p class="verse">How do I explain this healing<br>
  To a heart that's never broke?<br>
  But the ones who've tasted know—<br>
  The Spirit witnessed. Now I know.</p>
  <p class="section"><strong>[Chorus 2]</strong></p>
  <p class="chorus">I have tasted the Light<br>
  Grace of the Living Son of God<br>
  And my heart is full, my heart is full</p>
  <p class="chorus">His truth rises within me like the morning sun<br>
  And it calls me to move<br>
  Oh, it calls me to move</p>
  <p class="chorus">I will dance before the Lord<br>
  With all the life He's given me<br>
  I'll use these hands to bear His light</p>
  <p class="chorus">Now I'm reborn<br>
  Now I'm free</p>
  <p class="section"><strong>[Verse 3]</strong></p>
  <p class="verse">Like the woman at the well<br>
  I ran to tell what I had found<br>
  Not because my life was perfect—<br>
  Because His mercy wore me down</p>
  <p class="verse">We are not called to walk in silence<br>
  We are not called to walk alone<br>
  There's a family, there's a table<br>
  There's a testimony—there's a home</p>
  <p class="section"><strong>[Bridge]</strong></p>
  <p class="verse">When the shadows press their questions<br>
  And the old doubts claw their way<br>
  I return to the moment<br>
  When He spoke and night became day</p>
  <p class="verse">What witness could be greater<br>
  Than the peace He put in me?<br>
  So I choose to remember—<br>
  And the Light comes back to me</p>
  <p class="section"><strong>[Interlude]</strong></p>
  <p class="verse">Come unto Him<br>
  Learn of Him<br>
  Believe in Him<br>
  Follow Him<br>
  Remember Him</p>
  <p class="section"><strong>[Final Chorus]</strong></p>
  <p class="chorus">I have tasted the Light<br>
  Grace of the Living Son of God<br>
  And my heart is full, my heart is full!</p>
  <p class="chorus">His truth rises within me like the morning sun<br>

  Oh, it calls me to move!</p>

  Now I'm free!</p>
  <p class="section"><strong>[Outro]</strong></p>
  <p class="verse">Now I'm reborn...<br>
  Now I'm free...</p>
  <p class="verse">I have tasted the Light<br>
  (Grace of the Living Son of God)<br>
  I have tasted the Light<br>
  (My heart is full, my heart is full)</p>
  <p class="verse">I have tasted the Light...<br>
  In the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.</p>

<h2 id="you-have-come-this-far">{% sentence 9 %}You Have Come This Far on the Journey{% endsentence %}</h2>

{% sentence 10 %}You have searched in plainness.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 11 %}You have asked honest questions about the purpose of your existence.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 12 %}You have considered the limits of human knowledge and opened yourself to the possibility of something more.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 13 %}You have learned to pray—to speak to God and listen for His voice.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 14 %}You have planted the seed in yourself.{% endsentence %}

{% sentence 15 %}And now?{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 16 %}Has the seed begun to swell within you?{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 17 %}Have you tasted something sweet—a warmth in your heart, a clarity in your mind, a peace you cannot quite explain?{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 18 %}Do you stand at the threshold, willing to believe but not yet certain, hoping that what you have heard is true?{% endsentence %}

{% sentence 19 %}*I have tasted the Light, Grace of the Living Son of God, and my heart is full.*{% endsentence %}

{% sentence 20 %}Then you are ready for what comes next.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 21 %}This chapter is not about convincing you to search.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 22 %}You are already searching.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 23 %}It is about what faith in Jesus Christ actually is—and what it does to those who embrace it.{% endsentence %}

<h2 id="more-than-belief">{% sentence 24 %}More Than Belief{% endsentence %}</h2>

{% sentence 25 %}Faith is not mere belief.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 26 %}The scriptures are clear on this point: "The devils also believe, and tremble" (James 2:19).{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 27 %}Satan and his servants know that God exists.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 28 %}They know Jesus is the Christ.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 29 %}Satan's knowledge is perfect—and it brings him only misery.{% endsentence %}

{% sentence 30 %}Then, what separates saving faith from the belief of devils?{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 31 %}Surrender.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 32 %}Trust.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 33 %}Willingness to be changed by the power of God.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 34 %}Belief says, "I acknowledge this is true."{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 35 %}Faith says, "I will stake my life on it. I will let it reshape me. I will follow where it leads."{% endsentence %}

{% sentence 36 %}The scriptures define faith as "the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen" (Hebrews 11:1).{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 37 %}It is hope for things "which are not seen, which are true" (Alma 32:21)—emphasis on *true*.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 38 %}Faith is not believing whatever we wish were real.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 39 %}It is trusting in what is real before we have full proof of it.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 40 %}And we "receive no witness until after the trial of [our] faith" (Ether 12:6)—the evidence comes to those who step forward, not to those who demand proof before they will move.{% endsentence %}

{% sentence 41 %}Faith is not passive.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 42 %}It is the principle of action—the force that moves us from knowing to becoming.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 43 %}Joseph Smith taught that faith is "the moving cause of all action" and "the principle of power also, in all intelligent beings, whether in heaven or on earth" (Lectures on Faith 1:13, 15).{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 44 %}When we exercise faith, though imperfectly, we take hold of that same principle of power that called light out of darkness, that formed the Earth and life upon it.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 45 %}Faith is the same principle of power that caused "the blind [to] receive their sight, and the lame [to] walk, the lepers [to be] cleansed, and the deaf [to] hear, the dead [to be] raised up" (Matthew 11:5).{% endsentence %}

{% sentence 46 %}And here is the beautiful paradox: faith begins as we reach toward God, but it becomes His gift to us as He reaches back.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 47 %}We extend a particle of hope; He returns it multiplied into knowledge.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 48 %}We offer a desire to believe; He transforms it into testimony.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 49 %}Faith is both our effort and His grace, woven together until we cannot tell where one ends and the other begins.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 50 %}Faith is one's relationship with God.{% endsentence %}

{% sentence 51 %}*His truth rises in me like the morning sun, and it calls me to move.*{% endsentence %}

<h2 id="born-again">{% sentence 52 %}Born Again{% endsentence %}</h2>

{% sentence 53 %}Jesus taught that unless we are born again, we cannot see the kingdom of God.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 54 %}This is not just a metaphor.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 55 %}It is the Good Physician's prescription for Salvation.{% endsentence %}

{% sentence 56 %}Those who have experienced the promised "rebirth" speak of a mighty change of heart—not self-improvement by one's own will and works—but a transformation of the whole soul by the miraculous power of God.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 57 %}Not to personal perfection, but providing a glimpse of God's perfect love for us.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 58 %}The weight of past failures lifts.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 59 %}Guilt releases its grip.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 60 %}Something fresh floods in where heaviness once lived.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 61 %}The world is still the same, but you are different, and so you see all of creation through new eyes.{% endsentence %}

{% sentence 62 %}For some, the new birth arrives like lightning—sudden, unmistakable, unforgettable.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 63 %}For others, it comes like dawn—so gradual they cannot name the moment the light became unmistakable.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 64 %}Both are real.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 65 %}God works differently with different souls.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 66 %}What matters is whether the tree is growing, not how dramatically the seed first sprouted.{% endsentence %}

{% sentence 67 %}Remember that Alma compared the word of God to a seed (see Alma 32:28–43)?{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 68 %}This soul-enriching transformation is what the seed becomes when it takes root.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 69 %}He promised: the word would "enlarge your soul" and "enlighten your understanding" and become "delicious" to you.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 70 %}That swelling, that light, that sweetness—this is the new birth beginning.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 71 %}It is Christ entering your life not as a concept but as a presence.{% endsentence %}

{% sentence 72 %}We cannot spiritually birth ourselves.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 73 %}We can only say yes to the One who offers to make us new.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 74 %}And when His Spirit moves through our spirit, when we feel the old self falling away, we understand why Jesus used the language of birth.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 75 %}It is profound.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 76 %}It is real.{% endsentence %}

{% sentence 77 %}*Now I'm reborn. Now I'm free.*{% endsentence %}

<h2 id="surrender-as-strength">{% sentence 78 %}Surrender as Strength{% endsentence %}</h2>

{% sentence 79 %}The world teaches that surrender is weakness.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 80 %}To yield is to lose.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 81 %}To submit is to be conquered.{% endsentence %}

{% sentence 82 %}But surrender to Christ is victory.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 83 %}It is the only true freedom.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 84 %}The chains we thought were holding us together were actually holding us down.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 85 %}The control we thought was protecting us was imprisoning us.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 86 %}When we let go and fall into His arms, we discover He was not waiting to diminish us but to enlarge us—to fill us with His light, His love, and His own life.{% endsentence %}

{% sentence 87 %}This is why those who have surrendered speak not of loss but of gain.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 88 %}Not of bondage but of liberation.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 89 %}The joy of serving Him is not a grim duty fulfilled.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 90 %}It is the delight of a heart that has found its home, hands that have found their purpose, feet that cannot be still.{% endsentence %}

{% sentence 91 %}*I will dance before the Lord with all the life He's given me.*{% endsentence %}

<h2 id="grace-and-our-response">{% sentence 92 %}Grace and Our Response{% endsentence %}</h2>

{% sentence 93 %}Are we saved by what God does for us?{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 94 %}Or are we saved by what we do for God?{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 95 %}The answer to both questions is yes.{% endsentence %}

{% sentence 96 %}Grace is God reaching toward us—unearned, undeserved, freely offered.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 97 %}It completes what we cannot complete ourselves.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 98 %}But grace that is truly received changes us.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 99 %}It does not leave us where it found us.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 100 %}When God's love enters a heart, that heart beats differently.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 101 %}Hands that were closed begin to open.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 102 %}Feet that were still begin to move.{% endsentence %}

{% sentence 103 %}This is not payment for salvation.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 104 %}It is the fruit of salvation, the fruits of the Spirit.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 105 %}A tree that has been made alive will bear fruit—not to prove it deserves sunlight, but because that is what living trees do with light.{% endsentence %}

{% sentence 106 %}We do not believe that reaching perfection in this mortal lifetime is required, though it is commanded that we be perfect.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 107 %}Perfection is the direction of the journey, not the price of admission.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 108 %}Christ commands us to aim at the Father's own wholeness; grace carries us forward when we fall short.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 109 %}The consistent direction of growth matters far more than any level of attainment.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 110 %}But genuine faith produces genuine change.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 111 %}If nothing is growing, we might ask whether the seed was ever truly planted, protected, nourished…{% endsentence %}

{% sentence 112 %}*I'll use these hands to bear His light.*{% endsentence %}

<h2 id="fellowship-with-disciples">{% sentence 113 %}Fellowship with Disciples{% endsentence %}</h2>

{% sentence 114 %}Faith in Christ is personal, but it is not private.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 115 %}From the beginning, the Lord has gathered His followers into communities of covenant and care.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 116 %}He calls us not only to Himself but to one another.{% endsentence %}

{% sentence 117 %}There are things that can only be learned in fellowship.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 118 %}Patience is forged when we must bear with one another's weaknesses.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 119 %}Forgiveness is practiced when brothers and sisters disappoint us—as we disappoint them.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 120 %}Love is perfected not in solitude but in the daily friction and grace of life together.{% endsentence %}

{% sentence 121 %}The early Christians "continued steadfastly in the apostles' doctrine and fellowship, and in breaking of bread, and in prayers" (Acts 2:42).{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 122 %}They understood that discipleship is communal.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 123 %}We need teachers to instruct us, elders to guide us, peers to walk beside us, and younger souls to serve.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 124 %}We need the sacraments that can only be administered in gathered worship.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 125 %}We need the correction that comes from those who know us well enough to speak truth in love.{% endsentence %}

{% sentence 126 %}Do not attempt to follow Christ alone.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 127 %}Find His people.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 128 %}Join them.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 129 %}Bear their burdens as they bear yours.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 130 %}"Where two or three are gathered together in my name," Jesus promised, "there am I in the midst of them" (Matthew 18:20).{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 131 %}His presence is found in the fellowship as surely as in the private closet of prayer.{% endsentence %}

{% sentence 132 %}The body of Christ is not a metaphor.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 133 %}It is a description of how His work is done in the world—through hands and feet and voices joined together in His service.{% endsentence %}

{% sentence 134 %}Be wary of seeking a congregation that offers only pleasing doctrines and affirmation without accountability.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 135 %}The body of Christ is a family, and families speak truth to one another—sometimes uncomfortable truth.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 136 %}If no one in your fellowship ever challenges you, you may have found an audience, not a family.{% endsentence %}

<h2 id="bearing-testimony">{% sentence 137 %}Bearing Testimony{% endsentence %}</h2>

{% sentence 138 %}Faith that remains hidden is faith that remains incomplete.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 139 %}The natural response to encountering the living Christ is to speak of Him—to bear testimony.{% endsentence %}

{% sentence 140 %}Consider the woman at the well.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 141 %}She had lived a complicated life—five husbands, and the man she was with was not her husband.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 142 %}Yet when she encountered Christ, she did not wait until her life was in order to speak of Him.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 143 %}She left her waterpot and ran to the city: "Come, see a man, which told me all things that ever I did: is not this the Christ?" (John 4:29).{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 144 %}Her testimony was simple, honest, and immediate.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 145 %}And many believed because of her word.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 146 %}She did not argue theology.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 147 %}She simply said, "Come and see."{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 148 %}That is testimony.{% endsentence %}

{% sentence 149 %}A testimony is not an argument.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 150 %}It is not proof designed to compel agreement.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 151 %}It is witness: a personal declaration of what you have experienced, what you have come to know, what has changed in you because of Him.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 152 %}"I was blind, but now I see."{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 153 %}"I was lost, but He found me."{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 154 %}"I planted the seed, and it grew."{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 155 %}No one can argue with your experience.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 156 %}They can only hear it and feel the Spirit confirm or deny its truth to their own hearts.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 157 %}We are not the Savior; we cannot change others by force of will or with compelling arguments and proofs.{% endsentence %}

{% sentence 158 %}But testimony is borne in more than words.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 159 %}It is borne in how you live—in the kindness you show, the integrity you keep, the peace you carry into anxious rooms.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 160 %}Every act of Christlike love is testimony.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 161 %}Every choice to forgive when the world says retaliate is testimony.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 162 %}The life you live preaches a sermon that never ends.{% endsentence %}

{% sentence 163 %}Jesus said, "Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven" (Matthew 5:16).{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 164 %}This is testimony in action—light borne into darkness, not for your own glory but for His.{% endsentence %}

{% sentence 165 %}Do not wait until your faith is perfect to share it.{% endsentence %}
