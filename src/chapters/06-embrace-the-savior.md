<h2 id="you-have-come-this-far">{% sentence 9 %}You Have Come This Far on the Journey{% endsentence %}</h2>

{% sentence 10 %}You have searched in plainness.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 11 %}You have asked honest questions about the purpose of your existence.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 12 %}You have considered the limits of human knowledge and opened yourself to the possibility of something more.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 13 %}You have learned to pray—to speak to God and listen for His voice.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 14 %}You have planted the seed in yourself.{% endsentence %}

{% sentence 15 %}And now?{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 16 %}Has the seed begun to swell within you?{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 17 %}Have you tasted something sweet—a warmth in your heart, a clarity in your mind, a peace you cannot quite explain?{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 18 %}Do you stand at the threshold, willing to believe but not yet certain, hoping that what you have heard is true?{% endsentence %}

{% sentence 19 %}*I have tasted the Light, Grace of the Living Son of God, and my heart is full.*{% endsentence %}

{% sentence 20 %}Then you are ready for what comes next.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 21 %}This chapter is not about convincing you to search.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 22 %}You are already searching.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 23 %}It is about what faith in Jesus Christ actually is—and what it does to those who embrace it.{% endsentence %}

<h2 id="more-than-belief">{% sentence 24 %}More Than Belief{% endsentence %}</h2>

{% sentence 25 %}Faith is not mere belief.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 26 %}The scriptures are clear on this point: "The devils also believe, and tremble" (James 2:19).{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 27 %}Satan and his servants know that God exists.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 28 %}They know Jesus is the Christ.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 29 %}Satan's knowledge is perfect—and it brings him only misery.{% endsentence %}

{% sentence 30 %}Then, what separates saving faith from the belief of devils?{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 31 %}Surrender.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 32 %}Trust.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 33 %}Willingness to be changed by the power of God.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 34 %}Belief says, "I acknowledge this is true."{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 35 %}Faith says, "I will stake my life on it. I will let it reshape me. I will follow where it leads."{% endsentence %}

{% sentence 36 %}The scriptures define faith as "the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen" (Hebrews 11:1).{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 37 %}It is hope for things "which are not seen, which are true" (Alma 32:21)—emphasis on *true*.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 38 %}Faith is not believing whatever we wish were real.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 39 %}It is trusting in what is real before we have full proof of it.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 40 %}And we "receive no witness until after the trial of [our] faith" (Ether 12:6)—the evidence comes to those who step forward, not to those who demand proof before they will move.{% endsentence %}

{% sentence 41 %}Faith is not passive.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 42 %}It is the principle of action—the force that moves us from knowing to becoming.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 43 %}Joseph Smith taught that faith is "the moving cause of all action" and "the principle of power also, in all intelligent beings, whether in heaven or on earth" (Lectures on Faith 1:13, 15).{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 44 %}When we exercise faith, though imperfectly, we take hold of that same principle of power that called light out of darkness, that formed the Earth and life upon it.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 45 %}Faith is the same principle of power that caused "the blind [to] receive their sight, and the lame [to] walk, the lepers [to be] cleansed, and the deaf [to] hear, the dead [to be] raised up" (Matthew 11:5).{% endsentence %}

{% sentence 46 %}And here is the beautiful paradox: faith begins as we reach toward God, but it becomes His gift to us as He reaches back.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 47 %}We extend a particle of hope; He returns it multiplied into knowledge.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 48 %}We offer a desire to believe; He transforms it into testimony.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 49 %}Faith is both our effort and His grace, woven together until we cannot tell where one ends and the other begins.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 50 %}Faith is one's relationship with God.{% endsentence %}

{% sentence 51 %}*His truth rises in me like the morning sun, and it calls me to move.*{% endsentence %}

<h2 id="born-again">{% sentence 52 %}Born Again{% endsentence %}</h2>

{% sentence 53 %}Jesus taught that unless we are born again, we cannot see the kingdom of God.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 54 %}This is not just a metaphor.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 55 %}It is the Good Physician's prescription for Salvation.{% endsentence %}

{% sentence 56 %}Those who have experienced the promised "rebirth" speak of a mighty change of heart—not self-improvement by one's own will and works—but a transformation of the whole soul by the miraculous power of God.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 57 %}Not to personal perfection, but providing a glimpse of God's perfect love for us.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 58 %}The weight of past failures lifts.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 59 %}Guilt releases its grip.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 60 %}Something fresh floods in where heaviness once lived.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 61 %}The world is still the same, but you are different, and so you see all of creation through new eyes.{% endsentence %}

{% sentence 62 %}For some, the new birth arrives like lightning—sudden, unmistakable, unforgettable.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 63 %}For others, it comes like dawn—so gradual they cannot name the moment the light became unmistakable.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 64 %}Both are real.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 65 %}God works differently with different souls.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 66 %}What matters is whether the tree is growing, not how dramatically the seed first sprouted.{% endsentence %}

{% sentence 67 %}Remember that Alma compared the word of God to a seed (see Alma 32:28–43)?{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 68 %}This soul-enriching transformation is what the seed becomes when it takes root.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 69 %}He promised: the word would "enlarge your soul" and "enlighten your understanding" and become "delicious" to you.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 70 %}That swelling, that light, that sweetness—this is the new birth beginning.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 71 %}It is Christ entering your life not as a concept but as a presence.{% endsentence %}

{% sentence 72 %}We cannot spiritually birth ourselves.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 73 %}We can only say yes to the One who offers to make us new.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 74 %}And when His Spirit moves through our spirit, when we feel the old self falling away, we understand why Jesus used the language of birth.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 75 %}It is profound.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 76 %}It is real.{% endsentence %}

{% sentence 77 %}*Now I'm reborn. Now I'm free.*{% endsentence %}

<h2 id="surrender-as-strength">{% sentence 78 %}Surrender as Strength{% endsentence %}</h2>

{% sentence 79 %}The world teaches that surrender is weakness.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 80 %}To yield is to lose.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 81 %}To submit is to be conquered.{% endsentence %}

{% sentence 82 %}But surrender to Christ is victory.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 83 %}It is the only true freedom.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 84 %}The chains we thought were holding us together were actually holding us down.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 85 %}The control we thought was protecting us was imprisoning us.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 86 %}When we let go and fall into His arms, we discover He was not waiting to diminish us but to enlarge us—to fill us with His light, His love, and His own life.{% endsentence %}

{% sentence 87 %}This is why those who have surrendered speak not of loss but of gain.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 88 %}Not of bondage but of liberation.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 89 %}The joy of serving Him is not a grim duty fulfilled.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 90 %}It is the delight of a heart that has found its home, hands that have found their purpose, feet that cannot be still.{% endsentence %}

{% sentence 91 %}*I will dance before the Lord with all the life He's given me.*{% endsentence %}

<h2 id="grace-and-our-response">{% sentence 92 %}Grace and Our Response{% endsentence %}</h2>

{% sentence 93 %}Are we saved by what God does for us?{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 94 %}Or are we saved by what we do for God?{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 95 %}The answer to both questions is yes.{% endsentence %}

{% sentence 96 %}Grace is God reaching toward us—unearned, undeserved, freely offered.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 97 %}It completes what we cannot complete ourselves.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 98 %}But grace that is truly received changes us.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 99 %}It does not leave us where it found us.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 100 %}When God's love enters a heart, that heart beats differently.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 101 %}Hands that were closed begin to open.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 102 %}Feet that were still begin to move.{% endsentence %}

{% sentence 103 %}This is not payment for salvation.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 104 %}It is the fruit of salvation, the fruits of the Spirit.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 105 %}A tree that has been made alive will bear fruit—not to prove it deserves sunlight, but because that is what living trees do with light.{% endsentence %}

{% sentence 106 %}We do not believe that reaching perfection in this mortal lifetime is required, though it is commanded that we be perfect.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 107 %}Perfection is the direction of the journey, not the price of admission.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 108 %}Christ commands us to aim at the Father's own wholeness; grace carries us forward when we fall short.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 109 %}The consistent direction of growth matters far more than any level of attainment.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 110 %}But genuine faith produces genuine change.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 111 %}If nothing is growing, we might ask whether the seed was ever truly planted, protected, nourished…{% endsentence %}

{% sentence 112 %}*I'll use these hands to bear His light.*{% endsentence %}

<h2 id="fellowship-with-disciples">{% sentence 113 %}Fellowship with Disciples{% endsentence %}</h2>

{% sentence 114 %}Faith in Christ is personal, but it is not private.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 115 %}From the beginning, the Lord has gathered His followers into communities of covenant and care.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 116 %}He calls us not only to Himself but to one another.{% endsentence %}

{% sentence 117 %}There are things that can only be learned in fellowship.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 118 %}Patience is forged when we must bear with one another's weaknesses.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 119 %}Forgiveness is practiced when brothers and sisters disappoint us—as we disappoint them.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 120 %}Love is perfected not in solitude but in the daily friction and grace of life together.{% endsentence %}

{% sentence 121 %}The early Christians "continued steadfastly in the apostles' doctrine and fellowship, and in breaking of bread, and in prayers" (Acts 2:42).{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 122 %}They understood that discipleship is communal.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 123 %}We need teachers to instruct us, elders to guide us, peers to walk beside us, and younger souls to serve.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 124 %}We need the sacraments that can only be administered in gathered worship.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 125 %}We need the correction that comes from those who know us well enough to speak truth in love.{% endsentence %}

{% sentence 126 %}Do not attempt to follow Christ alone.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 127 %}Find His people.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 128 %}Join them.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 129 %}Bear their burdens as they bear yours.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 130 %}"Where two or three are gathered together in my name," Jesus promised, "there am I in the midst of them" (Matthew 18:20).{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 131 %}His presence is found in the fellowship as surely as in the private closet of prayer.{% endsentence %}

{% sentence 132 %}The body of Christ is not a metaphor.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 133 %}It is a description of how His work is done in the world—through hands and feet and voices joined together in His service.{% endsentence %}

{% sentence 134 %}Be wary of seeking a congregation that offers only pleasing doctrines and affirmation without accountability.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 135 %}The body of Christ is a family, and families speak truth to one another—sometimes uncomfortable truth.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 136 %}If no one in your fellowship ever challenges you, you may have found an audience, not a family.{% endsentence %}

<h2 id="bearing-testimony">{% sentence 137 %}Bearing Testimony{% endsentence %}</h2>

{% sentence 138 %}Faith that remains hidden is faith that remains incomplete.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 139 %}The natural response to encountering the living Christ is to speak of Him—to bear testimony.{% endsentence %}

{% sentence 140 %}Consider the woman at the well.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 141 %}She had lived a complicated life—five husbands, and the man she was with was not her husband.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 142 %}Yet when she encountered Christ, she did not wait until her life was in order to speak of Him.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 143 %}She left her waterpot and ran to the city: "Come, see a man, which told me all things that ever I did: is not this the Christ?" (John 4:29).{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 144 %}Her testimony was simple, honest, and immediate.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 145 %}And many believed because of her word.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 146 %}She did not argue theology.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 147 %}She simply said, "Come and see."{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 148 %}That is testimony.{% endsentence %}

{% sentence 149 %}A testimony is not an argument.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 150 %}It is not proof designed to compel agreement.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 151 %}It is witness: a personal declaration of what you have experienced, what you have come to know, what has changed in you because of Him.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 152 %}"I was blind, but now I see."{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 153 %}"I was lost, but He found me."{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 154 %}"I planted the seed, and it grew."{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 155 %}No one can argue with your experience.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 156 %}They can only hear it and feel the Spirit confirm or deny its truth to their own hearts.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 157 %}We are not the Savior; we cannot change others by force of will or with compelling arguments and proofs.{% endsentence %}

{% sentence 158 %}But testimony is borne in more than words.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 159 %}It is borne in how you live—in the kindness you show, the integrity you keep, the peace you carry into anxious rooms.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 160 %}Every act of Christlike love is testimony.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 161 %}Every choice to forgive when the world says retaliate is testimony.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 162 %}The life you live preaches a sermon that never ends.{% endsentence %}

{% sentence 163 %}Jesus said, "Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven" (Matthew 5:16).{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 164 %}This is testimony in action—light borne into darkness, not for your own glory but for His.{% endsentence %}

{% sentence 165 %}Do not wait until your faith is perfect to share it.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 166 %}Testimony grows stronger in the telling.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 167 %}As you speak what you know—however small it seems—the Spirit confirms it to you even as it reaches toward others.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 168 %}The seed you plant in another's heart waters the tree in your own.{% endsentence %}

<h2 id="when-faith-is-tested">{% sentence 169 %}When Faith Is Tested{% endsentence %}</h2>

{% sentence 170 %}There will be seasons when the light dims.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 171 %}The world grows loud.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 172 %}Hardship obscures what once seemed clear.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 173 %}Doubt creeps in where certainty lived.{% endsentence %}

{% sentence 174 %}Know this: doubt is not the opposite of faith.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 175 %}Fear and despair is.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 176 %}Doubt that keeps seeking is faith wearing different clothes.{% endsentence %}

{% sentence 177 %}The Lord counseled a struggling disciple: "Cast your mind upon the night that you cried unto me in your heart. Did I not speak peace to your mind concerning the matter? What greater witness can you have than from God?" (D&C 6:22–23).{% endsentence %}

{% sentence 178 %}You have felt it before.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 179 %}The seed has swelled.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 180 %}The light has tasted sweet.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 181 %}Return to that memory.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 182 %}Let it anchor you until the sun rises again within you.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 183 %}Faith is both gift and choice—God gives the witness; we choose whether to remember it.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 184 %}Return to the wellspring of living waters often.{% endsentence %}

<h2 id="the-invitation">{% sentence 185 %}The Invitation{% endsentence %}</h2>

{% sentence 186 %}This is what faith offers: a heart made full, a life made new, a purpose that outlasts death.{% endsentence %}

{% sentence 187 %}This is what faith asks: surrender, trust, willingness to be changed and to let that change overflow into how you live and love and serve.{% endsentence %}

{% sentence 188 %}This is what faith becomes: testimony borne in word and deed, fellowship with fellow disciples, light carried into every room you enter, joy that cannot be contained.{% endsentence %}

{% sentence 189 %}Come unto Him.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 190 %}Learn of Him.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 191 %}Believe in Him.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 192 %}Follow Him.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 193 %}Remember Him.{% endsentence %}

{% sentence 194 %}We promise you, in the name of Jesus Christ, that if you do these things your faith will be made unshakable by the power of the Spirit of God.{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 195 %}"Then shall thy confidence wax strong in the presence of God" (D&C 121:45).{% endsentence %}
{% sentence 196 %}You will know—not merely believe, but *know*—that Jesus Christ is the Son of God, the Savior of all who receive Him, and that embracing Him is not loss but gain, not bondage but freedom, not the end of your journey but its true beginning.{% endsentence %}

{% sentence 197 %}*Now I'm reborn. Now I'm free.*{% endsentence %}

{% sentence 198 %}In the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.{% endsentence %}
