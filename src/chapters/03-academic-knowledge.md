  <p class="section"><strong>[Verse 1]</strong></p>
  <p class="verse">I've walked the avenues of life,<br>
  I've tasted rain and summer's heat.<br>
  I've gathered pearls of wisdom, simply beautiful,<br>
  And laid them down here at the Teacher's feet.<br>
  The world is organized in such complexity,<br>
  The Architect is found in every stone.<br>
  But even when survival needs are met,<br>
  A hunger stays for something yet unknown.</p>

  <p class="section"><strong>[Chorus]</strong></p>
  <p class="chorus">For truth is knowledge as things really are,<br>
  A light that shines on what is yet to come.<br>
  Science isn't blind and faith isn't lame<br>
  When we see them both as one.<br>
  It's a fuller way of walking on the road<br>
  Where every path to truth is joined together.<br>
  We're chasing down the meaning of our days,<br>
  By the love of God directed, now and ever.</p>

  <p class="section"><strong>[Verse 2]</strong></p>
  <p class="verse">I've built my intellectual altars to the mind<br>
  Through philosophy and arts and the sciences.<br>
  I've analyzed the patterns and the laws<br>
  And let my thinking be my sole reliance.<br>
  But academic means can only go so far,<br>
  They're limited by things we can't perceive.<br>
  We're ever learning, never coming to the truth<br>
  Without the courage to truly believe.</p>

  <p class="section"><strong>[Bridge]</strong></p>
  <p class="bridge">Now I'm standing at the edge of all my knowing,<br>
  Looking out across the mist and rain.<br>
  Reason is a candle in the wind<br>
  If it cannot take away the pain.</p>

  <p class="section"><strong>[Build]</strong></p>
  <p class="verse">Why is there something rather than nothing at all?<br>
  Does who I am persist beyond the grave?<br>
  I'm reaching for the sight that has been hidden,<br>
  For the spirit that the Savior came to save.</p>

  <p class="section"><strong>[Climax]</strong></p>
  <p class="chorus"><strong>I choose to experiment upon the word.<br>
  I choose the foresight of the prophecy.<br>
  The spirit speaks what senses never heard—<br>
  It's the power of God that sets the seeker free!</strong></p>

  <p class="section"><strong>[Outro]</strong></p>
  <p class="verse">So I'll walk in wondering humility,<br>
  Recognizing that I know so very little.<br>
  The world may shift like shadows on the wall,<br>
  But a simple truth is resting in the middle.</p>

  <p class="verse">Great ignorance might lead a man to fear,<br>
  And knowledge brings a measure of our sorrow.<br>
  But wisdom brings a peace that's resting here<br>
  And a hope for every bright tomorrow.</p>

  <p class="verse"><em>Life has grand purpose.<br>
  A beautiful and simple way.<br>
  In the name of Jesus Christ,<br>
  Amen.</em></p>

podcastTranscript: |
  <p><strong>Host:</strong> Welcome back to Words of Plainness Podcasts. I'm here with Brother Aaron Powner, and today we're exploring Chapter Three of his book—a chapter called "Academic Knowledge." Brother Aaron, this title might surprise some listeners. Why would a book about faith spend an entire chapter on academics?</p>

  <p><strong>Aaron:</strong> That's a good question, and it gets right to the heart of what we're trying to do here. Latter-day Saints believe in eternal progression—the idea that learning and growing is central to God's plan for us. So we place tremendous value on education. But here's what's important: we don't see academic knowledge and spiritual knowledge as enemies. We see them as companions in the same cause.</p>

  <p><strong>Host:</strong> Companions? That's an interesting word choice.</p>

  <p><strong>Aaron:</strong> It's intentional. Albert Einstein once said that science without religion is lame, and religion without science is blind. We agree with that completely. If there ever seems to be a conflict between what we learn academically and what we learn spiritually, we believe that conflict comes from incomplete information—in one domain or the other, or both. After all, there's only one ultimate truth... And God isn't threatened by honest inquiry.</p>

  <p><strong>Host:</strong> So you're not asking people to choose between faith and reason?</p>

  <p><strong>Aaron:</strong> Not at all. We're inviting them to use both. In chapter three, my brother James and I lay out what we call the four paths to knowledge—the natural ways human beings learn. The first of these learning faculties are our physical senses: sight, hearing, touch, smell, taste, and the more subtle variations being explored in life sciences. The second of these learning pathways is authority—learning from teachers, experts, traditions. Third, there's reason—logic, analysis, working things out in our minds. And fourth, there's intuition—those moments when understanding seems to arrive without conscious effort.</p>

  <p><strong>Host:</strong> And all four of these are valuable?</p>

  <p><strong>Aaron:</strong> Absolutely! Philosophy enlivens the mind. The arts expand our perspective. The sciences reveal patterns in nature and give us remarkable understanding and technology. Human academic achievement is of incalculable worth. We've devoted our careers to education—we're not dismissing any of this. In fact, we celebrate it.</p>

  <p><strong>Host:</strong> I sense there's a "but" coming.</p>

  <p><strong>Aaron:</strong> There is. The chapter honestly acknowledges something that humble scholars throughout history have recognized: academic knowledge has limits. Even our most rigorously tested ideas only reach the level of "beyond reasonable doubt." We can never achieve absolute certainty through human faculties alone. History is littered with discarded theories—flat earth, geocentric universe, spontaneous generation. Brilliant people believed those things based on the best evidence available at the time.</p>

  <p><strong>Host:</strong> That's a humbling thought.</p>

  <p><strong>Aaron:</strong> It should be. We call it epistemic humility... And here's where it gets really interesting... There are certain questions—the deepest questions of human existence—that the natural framework of learning simply cannot answer. Why is there something rather than nothing? Does a loving God truly exist? Does my consciousness survive death? What is the ultimate purpose of my life? Science can describe how things work. It cannot explain why we exist.</p>

  <p><strong>Host:</strong> So the chapter brings readers to a kind of... ceiling?</p>

  <p><strong>Aaron:</strong> Exactly. We call it "the ceiling of the natural framework." And at that ceiling, every seeker faces a choice: accept the permanent limitation of ignorance on life's most vital questions... or consider whether there might be a fifth faculty for learning about truth—something beyond the four natural paths—a faculty that can take us further.</p>

  <p><strong>Host:</strong> I understand that's what the following chapter explores. So chapter three and four work together as a set? Two halves of a whole?</p>

  <p><strong>Aaron:</strong> Right again... Chapter Four is called "Spiritual Knowledge," and it's where we introduce what we believe is the faculty of learning that completes the others. But we wanted to be honest and thorough about academics first. We're not asking anyone to abandon reason. We're inviting them to add to it.</p>

  <p><strong>Host:</strong> One last question. What would you say to someone who's skeptical—who thinks this is just a way to smuggle faith past critical thinking?</p>

  <p><strong>Aaron:</strong> I'd say: don't be persuaded by our words alone. That's actually our invitation at the end of the chapter. Read it. Consider it. Test it against your own experience. We're not asking for blind acceptance—we're asking for an honest experiment. If the natural faculties have brought you as far as they can take you, and you're still hungry for answers... maybe it's time to explore what else might be available.</p>

  <p><strong>Host:</strong> Brother Aaron, thank you. The chapter is entitled "Academic Knowledge," and you can read it now at brotheraaron.org.</p>

  <p><strong>Aaron:</strong> Thank you. It's always a pleasure.</p>

<h2 id="faith-and-learning">{% sentence 0 %}Faith and Learning: Companions in the Same Cause{% endsentence %}</h2>

{% sentence 1 %}In spite of our variety of methods for coping with our very real hunger and thirst for truth, wisdom, and lasting happiness, we all continue to puzzle over the purpose of life.{% endsentence %} {% sentence 2 %}Human beings need to explore life and our surroundings.{% endsentence %} {% sentence 3 %}Even when survival needs are met, many of us continue to explore our existence out of curiosity.{% endsentence %} {% sentence 4 %}As we gather pearls of wisdom, we discover that the most satisfying truths are simply beautiful and beautifully simple.{% endsentence %}

{% sentence 5 %}As we mature and become more observant, many of us grow increasingly amazed by the energetic vitality and organized complexity of life and all of nature around us.{% endsentence %} {% sentence 6 %}In the spirit of exploration, human beings seek truth and meaning diligently, chasing down many paths of knowledge and avenues of life experience.{% endsentence %}

{% sentence 7 %}Latter-day Saints believe in eternal progression.{% endsentence %} {% sentence 8 %}Therefore, we place a high value on learning.{% endsentence %} {% sentence 9 %}We do distinguish between academic knowledge and spiritual knowledge, but believe these should be viewed as companions in the same cause.{% endsentence %} {% sentence 10 %}God and science are not mutually exclusive.{% endsentence %} {% sentence 11 %}If any conflict exists between academic knowledge and spiritual knowledge, it is the result of a lack of sufficient information within one or both domains of knowledge.{% endsentence %} {% sentence 12 %}Albert Einstein famously observed that science without religion is lame, and religion without science is blind (Albert Einstein, *The World as I See It*, 24–28).{% endsentence %} {% sentence 13 %}This chapter focuses on our views of academic knowledge, while our views of spirituality will be explored in the following chapter.{% endsentence %}

{% sentence 14 %}Please be patient in digesting the material for these two chapters.{% endsentence %} {% sentence 15 %}We have found high value in both types of knowledge, and have benefited from viewing them as two halves of a whole–what might be called a holistic epistemology.{% endsentence %} {% sentence 16 %}We believe all paths to knowledge are interconnected, each contributing something essential that the others cannot fully provide, together forming a more complete framework for understanding truth and our place within it.{% endsentence %}

<h2 id="the-nature-of-truth">{% sentence 17 %}The Nature of Truth: Faith Perspective{% endsentence %}</h2>

{% sentence 18 %}Many suspect that ultimate truth exists, but some question whether human beings are capable of "knowing" truth with any degree of certainty.{% endsentence %} {% sentence 19 %}Human beings have discovered so much about our existence in the universe, but what portion of reality yet escapes our attention?{% endsentence %} {% sentence 20 %}Of those quiet things yet hidden, both still and active, how much is there yet to learn?{% endsentence %} {% sentence 21 %}Regardless of our indefinable level of ignorance, what does it mean to have knowledge?{% endsentence %} {% sentence 22 %}What does it mean to know?{% endsentence %}

{% sentence 23 %}In preparation for our careers in education and throughout our combined decades in front of classrooms, my brother and I carefully considered these questions.{% endsentence %} {% sentence 24 %}Our formal studies and personal experiences reveal a disappointing lack of a unified definition of the word *knowledge*.{% endsentence %} {% sentence 25 %}In the place of clarity, numerous theories exist to explain the concept of knowledge.{% endsentence %} {% sentence 26 %}Though the definition of knowledge may be unclear, we feel it is important to plainly define the Latter-day Saint view of truth.{% endsentence %} {% sentence 27 %}One formal doctrine states: "Truth is knowledge of things as they are, and as they were, and as they are to come" (D&C 93:24).{% endsentence %} {% sentence 28 %}To this definition we add the following: The whole, ultimate truth is known only to God.{% endsentence %} {% sentence 29 %}There is only one ultimate truth; no separate truths exist for academics and spirituality.{% endsentence %} {% sentence 30 %}We can perceive or discover part of the whole truth, but we cannot know by academic means how correct this partial knowledge is in the ultimate sense.{% endsentence %} {% sentence 31 %}Truth does not have to be perceived, understood, believed, or justified to still be true.{% endsentence %}

<h2 id="how-human-beings-gain-knowledge">{% sentence 32 %}How Human Beings Gain Knowledge{% endsentence %}</h2>

{% sentence 33 %}So, how do human beings gain knowledge of truth?{% endsentence %} {% sentence 34 %}In the biological sense, our brains have no way to directly experience the universe that exists outside of our skulls.{% endsentence %} {% sentence 35 %}In general, learning theories indicate that our journey to knowledge begins when we become aware of objects or events around us.{% endsentence %} {% sentence 36 %}Most sensory information that is funneled into our brains by the nervous system is ignored, but when we choose to pay attention to our senses, we begin to mentally sort and prioritize our perceptions.{% endsentence %} {% sentence 37 %}Using our imagination, we very quickly form mental images—basic ideas—of objects or events in our environment.{% endsentence %} {% sentence 38 %}Some have argued over whether humans can accurately imagine or reliably interpret external reality.{% endsentence %}

{% sentence 39 %}Still, with amazing speed our minds collect, compare, contrast, and evaluate ideas.{% endsentence %} {% sentence 40 %}If we come to accept an idea as true, it becomes a belief.{% endsentence %} {% sentence 41 %}Our minds consciously and subconsciously combine related ideas and beliefs into increasingly complicated concepts.{% endsentence %} {% sentence 42 %}Over time and with reflection, we combine numerous related concepts into themes of knowledge.{% endsentence %} {% sentence 43 %}Eventually, each individual develops an overarching worldview, which is one's basic cognitive orientation or mindset.{% endsentence %} {% sentence 44 %}One's evolving worldview is strongly influenced by the society and culture in which he or she lives.{% endsentence %} {% sentence 45 %}Unfortunately, one's worldview tends to become more rigid with age.{% endsentence %}

<h3 id="boundary-belief-knowledge">{% sentence 46 %}The Boundary Between Belief and Knowledge{% endsentence %}</h3>

{% sentence 47 %}Returning to the questions asked earlier, at what point can a collection of ideas and beliefs be called knowledge?{% endsentence %} {% sentence 48 %}How do we know if our knowledge is true?{% endsentence %} {% sentence 49 %}Through the ages, philosophers and scientists have repeatedly attempted to define the boundary between belief and knowledge, but debate continues even today.{% endsentence %}

{% sentence 50 %}There are two general ways that the word *knowledge* is used.{% endsentence %} {% sentence 51 %}First, in academic arenas an idea must be justified by overwhelming and reliable evidence to be believed, and the nature of the evidence determines the degree of certainty that the belief is true.{% endsentence %} {% sentence 52 %}Many academics hold that if a belief is actually known, then it cannot be false—effectively equating knowledge and truth.{% endsentence %} {% sentence 53 %}But is it possible for an idea to be supported by overwhelming evidence, be universally accepted by all humans to be true, be of enormous practical use, and still manage to be false?{% endsentence %}

{% sentence 54 %}The second general way the word *knowledge* is used is in the common conversational sense.{% endsentence %} {% sentence 55 %}In everyday usage, the word *knowledge* means familiarity with ideas, skills, or people.{% endsentence %} {% sentence 56 %}Perhaps the common language usage of the word *knowledge* reflects a greater degree of common sense than philosophy or science in that no requirement is made that one believe a body of ideas in order to have knowledge of them.{% endsentence %} {% sentence 57 %}Conversely, academic ideas must meet a high degree of certainty to be called knowledge.{% endsentence %}

<h2 id="questions-that-motivate-our-search">{% sentence 58 %}Questions That Motivate Our Search{% endsentence %}</h2>

{% sentence 59 %}What does any of this have to do with Latter-day Saint Christianity?{% endsentence %} {% sentence 60 %}We challenge you to honestly answer the following questions for yourself: How can we have confidence that God truly exists?{% endsentence %} {% sentence 61 %}How can we have confidence that Jesus Christ was truly more than a man—that He was the very Son of God, even the divine Christ?{% endsentence %} {% sentence 62 %}How can we have confidence that our personal existence continues after death?{% endsentence %}

{% sentence 63 %}These questions motivate our writings.{% endsentence %} {% sentence 64 %}Indeed, these questions have motivated our living search for truth, meaning, and lasting happiness.{% endsentence %} {% sentence 65 %}We continue to keenly feel the driving need to explore both academic and spiritual knowledge.{% endsentence %} {% sentence 66 %}Our hope is that wisdom and peace will be the return on our investment.{% endsentence %}

<h2 id="the-four-paths-to-knowledge">{% sentence 67 %}The Four Paths to Knowledge{% endsentence %}</h2>

{% sentence 68 %}Putting aside arguments over definitions, the search for knowledge of truth must be confronted directly, carefully, and honestly.{% endsentence %} {% sentence 69 %}Most importantly, we must gain wisdom in the process—true wisdom being the correct application of knowledge.{% endsentence %} {% sentence 70 %}There are four general ways we learn.{% endsentence %} {% sentence 71 %}These are called paths to knowledge: **Physical Senses**—We can gather direct knowledge from our own powers of sight, smell, taste, hearing, and touch.{% endsentence %} {% sentence 72 %}**Authority**—We can gather indirect knowledge from others who claim to possess it with some degree of certainty.{% endsentence %} {% sentence 73 %}**Reason**—We can gather knowledge from the mental processes involved in the logical consideration of potential truths and the identification of false conclusions.{% endsentence %} {% sentence 74 %}**Intuition**—We can gather knowledge without any apparent use of the senses or application of reason.{% endsentence %}

<h3 id="learning-experience-authority">{% sentence 75 %}Learning from Experience and Authority{% endsentence %}</h3>

{% sentence 76 %}As paths to knowledge, *physical senses* and *authority* involve learning after gathering real-world experiences.{% endsentence %} {% sentence 77 %}Through our physical senses we can gain firsthand, practical knowledge by experiencing the consequences of our own personal choices.{% endsentence %} {% sentence 78 %}This can be dangerous, but it is effective.{% endsentence %} {% sentence 79 %}As a more careful approach, by listening to the teachings of authority figures we can gain secondhand, practical knowledge.{% endsentence %} {% sentence 80 %}This is learning from the experiences of others.{% endsentence %} {% sentence 81 %}By the paths of both physical senses and authority, knowledge and wisdom can be gained from *hindsight*.{% endsentence %}

<h3 id="reason-methods">{% sentence 82 %}Reason and Its Methods{% endsentence %}</h3>

{% sentence 83 %}As alternative paths to knowledge, *reason* and *intuition* involve learning without having had personal experiences.{% endsentence %} {% sentence 84 %}These are the most cautious approaches to learning.{% endsentence %} {% sentence 85 %}Reason is the conscious use of logic to formulate theoretical knowledge.{% endsentence %} {% sentence 86 %}Reasoning involves analysis of all information available, careful consideration of foreseeable consequences of our choices, and drawing creative conclusions.{% endsentence %}

<h3 id="intuition-academic-spiritual">{% sentence 87 %}Intuition: Academic and Spiritual{% endsentence %}</h3>

{% sentence 88 %}Intuition is a more mysterious path to knowledge, which manifests itself in at least two varieties.{% endsentence %} {% sentence 89 %}The first is *academic intuition*, sometimes called *rational intuition*.{% endsentence %} {% sentence 90 %}Academic intuition involves subconscious reasoning processes to draw conclusions in novel situations.{% endsentence %} {% sentence 91 %}Examples of such subconscious processes include recognition of sensory information, imaginative problem solving, and memories of emotions and past experience.{% endsentence %} {% sentence 92 %}This all happens without our conscious minds recognizing the source of such theoretical knowledge.{% endsentence %} {% sentence 93 %}Such intuited conclusions just seem to come to us mysteriously, yet this is a rational process.{% endsentence %}

{% sentence 94 %}The second type of intuition is *spiritual intuition*, sometimes called *irrational intuition*.{% endsentence %} {% sentence 95 %}No insult is implied here—*irrational* simply means that human reasoning is not the source of such knowledge.{% endsentence %} {% sentence 96 %}Spiritual intuition involves the direct perception of truth by inspiration or revelation, even to the extent of gaining knowledge of events or foreknowledge of the consequences of our choices that could not come by any other means.{% endsentence %} {% sentence 97 %}Revelation (received consciously) and inspiration (perceived subconsciously) both result in spiritual knowledge.{% endsentence %} {% sentence 98 %}We use the term *spiritual* to describe this type of intuition in spite of disagreements over the existence of the human spirit.{% endsentence %} {% sentence 99 %}In general, the mechanisms by which knowledge is revealed or perceived by one who spiritually intuits truth are poorly understood.{% endsentence %} {% sentence 100 %}This type of intuition will be explored more fully in the following chapter.{% endsentence %}

<h3 id="hindsight-insight-foresight">{% sentence 101 %}Hindsight, Insight, and Foresight{% endsentence %}</h3>

{% sentence 102 %}In the cases of both reasoning and intuition, knowledge and wisdom can be gained from *insight*, sometimes also called *foresight* when relating to the future.{% endsentence %} {% sentence 103 %}Academic foresight results in predictions based on logic, whereas spiritual foresight results in prophecies based on revelation or inspiration.{% endsentence %}

<h2 id="testing-our-beliefs-for-truth">{% sentence 104 %}Testing Our Beliefs for Truth{% endsentence %}</h2>

{% sentence 105 %}The next important question we should ask is this: What do we do with knowledge when we get it?{% endsentence %} {% sentence 106 %}When we come to have confidence that an idea is true, we must incorporate the new belief into our existing frameworks of knowledge.{% endsentence %} {% sentence 107 %}This can be exhilarating, but it can also be uncomfortable.{% endsentence %} {% sentence 108 %}If a belief will not easily fit existing frameworks of knowledge, we are forced to adjust our collection of knowledge to incorporate the novel idea.{% endsentence %} {% sentence 109 %}Depending on the implications of the new ideas, such adjustments could be minor, or they might be so massive as to alter our entire worldview.{% endsentence %}

{% sentence 110 %}Being open to new ideas is seen as positive, but this requires both honesty and courage.{% endsentence %} {% sentence 111 %}If new ideas are too disruptive or too painful to accept, some reject them in favor of maintaining existing frameworks of knowledge.{% endsentence %} {% sentence 112 %}This can be a fear response.{% endsentence %} {% sentence 113 %}Some do not fearfully reject disruptive ideas outright, but instead adopt a noncommittal "wait and see" approach.{% endsentence %} {% sentence 114 %}Neither of these responses means that the new ideas are false, just that they were too overwhelming for an individual or group to handle at the moment.{% endsentence %}

<h3 id="three-tests-truth">{% sentence 115 %}Three Tests for Truth{% endsentence %}</h3>

{% sentence 116 %}Through the ages, philosophers have developed criteria by which beliefs can be tested.{% endsentence %} {% sentence 117 %}Three primary tests form a system of checks and balances for the mind.{% endsentence %}

{% sentence 118 %}*Correspondence* asks whether an idea matches external reality.{% endsentence %} {% sentence 119 %}A true idea must accurately describe things as they actually are.{% endsentence %} {% sentence 120 %}If I believe it is raining outside, I can look through the window and verify whether my belief corresponds to the observable facts.{% endsentence %}

{% sentence 121 %}*Coherence* asks whether an idea remains consistent across all situations.{% endsentence %} {% sentence 122 %}A true idea must be precisely true—not true in one circumstance and false in another.{% endsentence %} {% sentence 123 %}If objects fall toward the center of the Earth in my backyard, they must also fall toward the center in my neighbor's yard.{% endsentence %}

{% sentence 124 %}*Pragmatic utility* asks whether an idea produces reliable, beneficial results when applied.{% endsentence %} {% sentence 125 %}A true idea should work when put into practice.{% endsentence %} {% sentence 126 %}If a mathematical formula consistently predicts natural phenomena, its utility provides evidence of its truth.{% endsentence %}

{% sentence 127 %}These tests are valuable, but the honest inquirer must practice epistemic humility.{% endsentence %} {% sentence 128 %}Even our most rigorously tested knowledge reaches only the level of "beyond reasonable doubt."{% endsentence %} {% sentence 129 %}Human faculties, however refined, cannot guarantee absolute certainty.{% endsentence %} {% sentence 130 %}Humble scholars are always mindful of the very high probability of human error.{% endsentence %} {% sentence 131 %}Human pursuits that depend upon interpretation of evidence and the application of reason—whether in law or academics—often result in phrases like "the preponderance of evidence," "beyond a reasonable doubt," "truth value," and "degree of certainty."{% endsentence %}

<h2 id="the-contributions-of-human-learning">{% sentence 132 %}The Contributions of Human Learning{% endsentence %}</h2>

{% sentence 133 %}The many topics explored in our writings deal with the value and relevance of both academic and spiritual approaches to hindsight, insight, and foresight in the pursuit of truth, wisdom, and lasting happiness.{% endsentence %} {% sentence 134 %}Both approaches are of great value, yet each is more or less appropriate for differing circumstances.{% endsentence %} {% sentence 135 %}So how do we develop our talents for hindsight, insight, and foresight?{% endsentence %}

{% sentence 136 %}Over numberless generations, human beings have cultivated sophisticated academic approaches to gaining and sharing knowledge.{% endsentence %} {% sentence 137 %}Discovering interesting and useful patterns in the human experience can be approached academically with philosophies, arts, and sciences.{% endsentence %} {% sentence 138 %}These generate an enormous variety of viewpoints, wonderful questions, and precious information.{% endsentence %}

{% sentence 139 %}Philosophy enlivens the mind with exercises in questioning our existence and identifying alternative approaches to truth.{% endsentence %} {% sentence 140 %}The arts help us to better communicate, to experience the world from different viewpoints, and to more deeply consider both nature and the human condition.{% endsentence %} {% sentence 141 %}Social sciences help us to remember past lessons and to deal with the wide range of current human behaviors.{% endsentence %} {% sentence 142 %}Natural sciences help us to observe our surroundings, perceive patterns, and rapidly develop technologies that can dramatically expand the human experience.{% endsentence %} {% sentence 143 %}Formal sciences such as mathematics give us the ability to accurately measure, analyze, interpret, and predict natural patterns of all varieties with some degree of consistency.{% endsentence %}

{% sentence 144 %}Please do not get the false impression that we place little value on human academics.{% endsentence %} {% sentence 145 %}My brother and I have devoted much time and effort to acquaint ourselves with the learning of humankind.{% endsentence %} {% sentence 146 %}We have received a small collection of degrees and honors from universities.{% endsentence %} {% sentence 147 %}We have gained a sincere appreciation for the advancement of the human mind.{% endsentence %} {% sentence 148 %}The contributions of philosophies, arts, and sciences to the human experience are incalculable.{% endsentence %} {% sentence 149 %}Yet, we are sufficiently acquainted with these to grasp how much human beings have yet to learn and experience.{% endsentence %} {% sentence 150 %}We are painfully aware that there are numerous individuals of greater learning, but we are sufficiently educated to discern frustrating limitations to academic approaches to truth.{% endsentence %} {% sentence 151 %}In addition, we have both often heard the humble admission from within the ranks of the highly educated that the more humans learn, the stronger is the realization that we know very little.{% endsentence %}

<h2 id="the-limitations-of-academic-knowledge">{% sentence 152 %}The Limitations of Academic Knowledge{% endsentence %}</h2>

{% sentence 153 %}Philosophy!{% endsentence %} {% sentence 154 %}Arts!{% endsentence %} {% sentence 155 %}Sciences!{% endsentence %} {% sentence 156 %}For ages, these have been intellectual altars before which many have chosen to worship human ingenuity.{% endsentence %} {% sentence 157 %}Yet an embarrassing truth is recognized by humble and honest intellectuals: in spite of all our discoveries and greatness, human academics cannot produce or define ultimate truth and meaning with finality.{% endsentence %} {% sentence 158 %}Strangely, humans often react to this embarrassing limitation by trying in vain to define truth by means of democracy or even tyranny.{% endsentence %} {% sentence 159 %}Public sentiment and political actions cannot produce truth.{% endsentence %} {% sentence 160 %}Left to our own devices, we can only slowly and imperfectly approach genuine truth by academic means.{% endsentence %}

{% sentence 161 %}Mature scholars admit that academic knowledge is often based on sweeping, foundational assumptions.{% endsentence %} {% sentence 162 %}What if these academic assumptions are even a little wrong?{% endsentence %} {% sentence 163 %}In spite of our valuable accomplishments in analyzing the human condition and our noble construction of technology, human academics cannot produce ultimate truth.{% endsentence %} {% sentence 164 %}Instead, we often remain trapped in expansive and energetic debate, following an endless pattern of ever learning but never coming to a sure knowledge of truth (2 Timothy 3:7).{% endsentence %}

{% sentence 165 %}Anyone familiar with the history of science remembers well the lessons of discarded theories and models such as spontaneous generation, classical elements, flat earth, geocentric universe, and static universe.{% endsentence %} {% sentence 166 %}We like to think that we are far more advanced than the "primitive thinkers" who produced such ideas, when the fact is that ancient scholars were at least as brilliant as we are.{% endsentence %} {% sentence 167 %}Like us, they formed their philosophies and theories using the best evidence and tools available at the time.{% endsentence %} {% sentence 168 %}We also like to think that we have vastly superior evidence as well as more perfect tools of science with which to discern truth.{% endsentence %} {% sentence 169 %}It is humbling to consider what scholars of future generations will think of the imperfect theories and primitive tools of our day.{% endsentence %} {% sentence 170 %}Will we ever learn the lessons of simple humility?{% endsentence %}

<h3 id="assumption-intelligent-creator">{% sentence 171 %}The Assumption of an Intelligent Creator{% endsentence %}</h3>

{% sentence 172 %}Surveys indicate that most of us believe or suspect that there is intelligence behind the formation of our universe and the precious life it contains.{% endsentence %} {% sentence 173 %}Common experience dictates that every organized structure or system has an architect.{% endsentence %} {% sentence 174 %}An appealing belief is that complex organization is the footprint of intelligence.{% endsentence %} {% sentence 175 %}Many innately suspect that such order and majesty as are found in nature cannot be without cause or effect.{% endsentence %} {% sentence 176 %}The hopeful insist that there must be purpose to life and that our surroundings are a work of art, the result of devoted attention.{% endsentence %} {% sentence 177 %}There are many religions, each with their own doctrines and practices.{% endsentence %} {% sentence 178 %}The simple assumption is made that all of life and existence has come from a source and is moving toward some destiny.{% endsentence %}

{% sentence 179 %}Some view this hopeful assumption as an ignorant and uneducated mindset.{% endsentence %} {% sentence 180 %}"Advanced thought" sometimes leads the mind to question whether there is anything more to our existence than identifiable patterns of physical laws—an empirically identifiable evolution of the organization of matter, energy, and dimension.{% endsentence %} {% sentence 181 %}Paul spoke of this when he wrote: "The natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness unto him: neither can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned" (1 Corinthians 2:14).{% endsentence %} {% sentence 182 %}The possibility of genuine spiritual intuition is often rejected.{% endsentence %} {% sentence 183 %}Empiricism is simply an intellectually disguised statement of old: "I will only believe what I can see."{% endsentence %} {% sentence 184 %}Clinging only to humanistic knowledge restricts us to merely observing and manipulating our existence rather than seeking to identify its purpose.{% endsentence %} {% sentence 185 %}At best, this choice is a sore limitation on the human experience.{% endsentence %}

<h2 id="the-ceiling-of-the-natural-framework">{% sentence 186 %}The Ceiling of the Natural Framework{% endsentence %}</h2>

{% sentence 187 %}Think deeply on this world and the universe in which it moves.{% endsentence %} {% sentence 188 %}Change seems to be the only constant of our existence.{% endsentence %} {% sentence 189 %}The challenges and experiences that shape our lives are a kaleidoscope, continuously altering, fresh and new each day.{% endsentence %} {% sentence 190 %}Yet behind this backdrop of change there are simple truths that remain ever constant.{% endsentence %} {% sentence 191 %}Though we often search for truth collectively, the recognition, confirmation, and acceptance of these truths are an intensely personal, even spiritual, experience.{% endsentence %}

{% sentence 192 %}But how are we to begin searching, and what questions ought we to ask?{% endsentence %} {% sentence 193 %}We believe that the following are some of the most rewarding questions: How did all this change begin?{% endsentence %} {% sentence 194 %}Is there a higher intelligence guiding all this change?{% endsentence %} {% sentence 195 %}What are the origin and future of my changing personal existence?{% endsentence %} {% sentence 196 %}Is there a purpose to all this change?{% endsentence %} {% sentence 197 %}Is there help for me as my existence changes?{% endsentence %}

{% sentence 198 %}A more personal question that we must all confront is this: Am I ready, willing, and able to handle the answers to any of these questions?{% endsentence %} {% sentence 199 %}When honestly considering this last question, remember this insightful triplet of proverbs: great ignorance leads to great fear; great knowledge leads to great sorrow; great wisdom leads to great peace.{% endsentence %}

<h3 id="questions-exceed-framework">{% sentence 200 %}Questions That Exceed the Framework{% endsentence %}</h3>

{% sentence 201 %}This natural framework—the four faculties of senses, authority, reason, and academic intuition—is not defective.{% endsentence %} {% sentence 202 %}It functions precisely as designed for the questions it is equipped to address.{% endsentence %} {% sentence 203 %}Philosophy, arts, and sciences have yielded incalculable benefits to the human experience.{% endsentence %} {% sentence 204 %}Yet certain existential questions exceed its reach: Why is there something rather than nothing?{% endsentence %} {% sentence 205 %}Does a loving God truly exist?{% endsentence %} {% sentence 206 %}Does personal consciousness persist beyond death?{% endsentence %} {% sentence 207 %}What is the ultimate purpose of my existence?{% endsentence %}

{% sentence 208 %}Science can describe *how* things work, but it cannot explain *why* we exist.{% endsentence %} {% sentence 209 %}These are not failures of the natural framework—the framework itself predicts these limits.{% endsentence %} {% sentence 210 %}If ultimate truth is "knowledge of things as they are, and as they were, and as they are to come" (D&C 93:24), and our natural faculties perceive only a fraction of that whole, we should expect to reach a ceiling.{% endsentence %}

{% sentence 211 %}Here, the seeker faces a choice: accept permanent ignorance on life's most vital questions, or consider whether there exists a faculty beyond the natural ones.{% endsentence %}

<h2 id="our-witness">{% sentence 212 %}Our Witness{% endsentence %}</h2>

{% sentence 213 %}We, the writers, have come to know with certainty that there is more to humankind than our intellect and flesh.{% endsentence %} {% sentence 214 %}The reality of the human spirit and spiritual intuition may seem foolish to the educated mind.{% endsentence %} {% sentence 215 %}Often, those of great learning view the faithful as blind and deaf to the satisfaction of logic and reasoning.{% endsentence %} {% sentence 216 %}However, to those who have experienced the reality of the human spirit, men and women of exclusively empirical mindset seem blind and deaf to many of the most beautiful and moving experiences of life.{% endsentence %}

{% sentence 217 %}We have come to believe that it is good to seek knowledge, better to seek wisdom, and best to seek enlightenment.{% endsentence %} {% sentence 218 %}It is our experience that, whether through the practice of organized religion or through individual effort, the discerning of ultimate truth depends entirely upon spiritual intuition.{% endsentence %} {% sentence 219 %}During our lives we have learned a measure of spiritual sensitivity sufficient to have discovered some basic and important truths.{% endsentence %} {% sentence 220 %}Please give honest consideration to our writings.{% endsentence %}

{% sentence 221 %}Though we are still challenged by the worries, disappointments, and imperfections of mortal life, we have found profound underlying peace, hope, and joy in the application of the knowledge we wish to share.{% endsentence %} {% sentence 222 %}We have seen the happy effects of hope and faith in the lives of many others.{% endsentence %} {% sentence 223 %}We offer you the following personal witnesses in words of plainness: Ultimate truth can be known, at least in part—a significant and meaningful part.{% endsentence %} {% sentence 224 %}An individual, immortal spirit dwells within the flesh of each person.{% endsentence %} {% sentence 225 %}God lives and wishes to help us.{% endsentence %} {% sentence 226 %}Life has grand purpose and great meaning.{% endsentence %}

{% sentence 227 %}We caution you: do not be persuaded by our words alone!{% endsentence %} {% sentence 228 %}Though there are beautiful and hopeful ideas in this book, their truth can only be known by the power of God and verified through your own personal spiritual experiences (Matthew 16:17; Moroni 10:3–5).{% endsentence %} {% sentence 229 %}It is our simple hope that our efforts will engender in your heart a desire to search for God—though He has never been far from you—as well as a desire to search for truth, meaning, and lasting happiness (Acts 17:27; D&C 88:63).{% endsentence %} {% sentence 230 %}We invite you to experiment on our words (Alma 32:27).{% endsentence %}

{% sentence 231 %}If the natural faculties have brought you to the ceiling of what they can provide, the following chapter will explore the fifth faculty—the one that completes the others.{% endsentence %} {% sentence 232 %}We testify that God has not left His children without a way to know Him and the truths He has in store for us.{% endsentence %} {% sentence 233 %}This we witness in the name of Jesus Christ.{% endsentence %} {% sentence 234 %}Amen.{% endsentence %}
