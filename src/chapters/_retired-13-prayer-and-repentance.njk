      <h4>Speaking to God as Father</h4>
      <p>Latter-day Saints are taught to pray morning and evening, individually and as families. We kneel when possible. We address our Heavenly Father directly — not through saints, angels, or intermediaries — and close in the name of Jesus Christ. Prayer is not recitation. It is conversation: thanksgiving, confession, petition, and listening.</p>
      <p>The Prophet Alma taught his people to "cry unto God for all their support" and to "let their hearts be full, drawn out in prayer unto him continually" (<a class="scripture-link" href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/34?id=p27#p27" target="_blank">Alma 34:27</a>). This is not performance. It is relationship — the most important relationship any soul can cultivate.</p>

      <h4>A Witness of Daily Prayer</h4>
      <p>There was a season when I prayed out of duty and nothing else. I said the words, but my heart was a closed fist. Then one morning, after a night of deep trouble, I had nothing eloquent to offer — only "Father, I need Thee." That was all. And something broke open. Not the heavens. Something in me.</p>
      <p>Daily prayer has not made my life easy. But it has made me known to God in a way I cannot explain to anyone who has not experienced it. I have felt His awareness of me — not as a case to manage, but as a son He is shaping. The constancy of showing up before Him, even imperfectly, has changed the architecture of my soul.</p>
      <p class="bridge-text">If this resonates with you — or even if you are not sure it does — the next step invites you to choose one practice that fits where you are right now.</p>

      <h4>Daily Course Correction, Not Crisis Management</h4>
      <p>Many traditions treat repentance as an emergency measure — the response to serious transgression. Latter-day Saints believe that too, but we also understand repentance as a daily practice. It is the ongoing work of aligning our will with God's will. President Russell M. Nelson has taught that repentance is among the most joyful of all gospel principles — not because sin is trivial, but because the Savior's Atonement makes real change possible every single day.</p>
      <p>Repentance in its fullest Latter-day Saint sense involves recognition, godly sorrow, confession to God (and to priesthood leaders when necessary), abandonment of the sin, and restitution where possible. But the daily practice is simpler: honest self-examination, humble acknowledgment before God, and a sincere turning of the heart. The sacrament (communion) each Sunday provides a covenant renewal — a weekly reset in which we recommit and receive the promise of His Spirit again.</p>

    blesses: |
      <h4>The Freedom of Turning</h4>
      <p>I carried a grudge for years that I had convinced myself was righteous indignation. It poisoned conversations I didn't even know it was touching. When the Spirit finally showed me what I was doing — not in condemnation, but with piercing clarity — I did not feel crushed. I felt relieved. The weight had a name now, and it could be set down.</p>
      <p>That is what daily repentance has become in my life: not a catalogue of failures, but a willingness to be shown what I cannot see. The Savior does not expose our weakness to humiliate us. He exposes it so we can hand it to Him. "Come unto me," He said, "all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest" (<a class="scripture-link" href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/matt/11?id=p28#p28" target="_blank">Matthew 11:28</a>). That rest is real. I have felt it.</p>
      <p class="bridge-text">What might God be inviting you to set down? The commitment below offers a way to begin.</p>

      <h4>Willful Hunger with Sacred Purpose</h4>
      <p>On the first Sunday of each month, Latter-day Saints fast for two consecutive meals and donate the money saved — or more — as a "fast offering" to care for the poor. This is not a diet strategy or a spiritual stunt. It is an act of deliberate dependence on God, a physical declaration that "man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God" (<a class="scripture-link" href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/matt/4?id=p4#p4" target="_blank">Matthew 4:4</a>).</p>
      <p>Beyond the monthly fast, Saints fast whenever they face decisions that require divine guidance, when they seek healing for themselves or others, or when they need added spiritual power to overcome temptation. Alma testified that he had "fasted and prayed many days that I might know these things of myself" (<a class="scripture-link" href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/5?id=p46#p46" target="_blank">Alma 5:46</a>). Fasting sharpens spiritual receptivity in a way that prayer alone sometimes does not.</p>

    blesses: |
      <h4>What Hunger Taught Me</h4>
      <p>The first few fasts I kept were miserable. I watched the clock, thought about food, and accomplished nothing spiritual. I was fasting from meals. I had not yet learned to fast toward God.</p>
      <p>The fast that changed me came when my brother was diagnosed with cancer. I could not fix it. I could not pray eloquently. But I could give God my appetite, my comfort, my self-sufficiency — and say, "I have nothing left to offer but my willingness to go without." That fast was the most connected I have ever felt to the Savior, who went forty days without food and then faced the adversary with nothing but the word of God.</p>
      <p>Fasting does not manipulate God. It changes us. It strips away the noise and leaves us open to hear Him in ways our comfortable lives often do not permit.</p>

      <h4>Examining the State of Your Soul</h4>
      <p>Latter-day Saints practice regular spiritual self-assessment through multiple channels. Before participating in sacred temple ordinances, members meet privately with their bishop and answer questions about their faithfulness, honesty, family relationships, and obedience to covenants. This is not an inquisition — it is an invitation to honest reflection with a spiritual shepherd.</p>
      <p>But temple recommend interviews are not the only form of self-assessment. The Apostle Paul instructed the Corinthians to "examine yourselves, whether ye be in the faith" (<a class="scripture-link" href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/2-cor/13?id=p5#p5" target="_blank">2 Corinthians 13:5</a>). Alma asked his people, "Have ye spiritually been born of God? Have ye received his image in your countenances? Have ye experienced this mighty change in your hearts?" (<a class="scripture-link" href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/5?id=p14#p14" target="_blank">Alma 5:14</a>). These questions are not meant to produce guilt. They are meant to produce clarity.</p>
      <p>Whether you participate in formal worthiness interviews or not, the practice of honest spiritual inventory — asking yourself hard questions before God — is a discipline available to every person.</p>

    blesses: |
      <h4>The Gift of Being Seen</h4>
      <p>I once dreaded these conversations. I walked into the bishop's office carrying my inadequacies like a grocery list, certain that I would be found wanting. What I discovered was something different: a man called of God who listened with compassion, pointed me toward the Savior, and helped me see that the point was never perfection — it was direction.</p>
      <p>Self-assessment, when practiced in the Spirit, is not about scorekeeping. It is about trajectory. Am I moving toward Christ or away from Him? Am I kinder than I was six months ago? Do I pray with more intent? Have I kept my promises? These are the questions that matter, and they lose their sting when asked in the presence of grace.</p>
      <p class="bridge-text">The commitment below invites you to examine where you stand — not to condemn yourself, but to choose where you are heading.</p>

    commitments:
      - text: "I will prayerfully read Alma 5:14–30 and journal my honest answers to Alma's questions this week."
        tier: "covenant"
      - text: "I will set aside 15 minutes this week to honestly assess: Am I becoming the person I believe God wants me to be?"
        tier: "seeker"
      - text: "I will write down three values I hold most dear and honestly evaluate whether my daily actions reflect them."
        tier: "explore"

    reflection: "What is one question about your own spiritual life that you have been avoiding?"
