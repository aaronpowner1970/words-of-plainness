[Opening]
I was standing at the edge of something
When the questions finally stopped
And the silence wasn't empty
It was full of what I'd lost

I had nothing left to offer
But a willingness to fall
And the arms that caught me whispered:
"Child—this is what I made you for"

[Verse 1]
I used to think that faith meant certainty
That knowing was enough
But even demons believe in Him
And they tremble at the truth

It wasn't facts that finally freed me
It was falling to my knees
It was opening these hands I'd clenched so tight
And letting myself breathe

[Pre-Chorus]
What I thought was strength was prison
What I thought was loss is gain
Every wall I built for safety
Was the architecture of my chains

[Chorus 1]
I have tasted the Light
Grace of the Living Son of God
And my heart is full, my heart is full

His truth rises within me like the morning sun
And it calls me to move
Oh, it calls me to move

I will dance before the Lord
With all the life He's given me
I'll use these hands to bear His light

Now I'm reborn
Now I'm free

[Verse 2]
The world looks just the same this morning
But I swear these eyes are new
Something ancient woke inside me
Something deathless, something true

How do I explain this healing
To a heart that's never broke?
But the ones who've tasted know—
The Spirit witnessed. Now I know.

[Chorus 2]
I have tasted the Light
Grace of the Living Son of God
And my heart is full, my heart is full

His truth rises within me like the morning sun
And it calls me to move
Oh, it calls me to move

I will dance before the Lord
With all the life He's given me
I'll use these hands to bear His light

Now I'm reborn
Now I'm free

[Verse 3]
Like the woman at the well
I ran to tell what I had found
Not because my life was perfect—
Because His mercy wore me down

We are not called to walk in silence
We are not called to walk alone
There's a family, there's a table
There's a testimony—there's a home

[Bridge]
When the shadows press their questions
And the old doubts claw their way
I return to the moment
When He spoke and night became day

What witness could be greater
Than the peace He put in me?
So I choose to remember—
And the Light comes back to me

[Interlude]
Come unto Him
Learn of Him
Believe in Him
Follow Him
Remember Him

[Final Chorus]
I have tasted the Light
Grace of the Living Son of God
And my heart is full, my heart is full!

His truth rises within me like the morning sun
And it calls me to move
Oh, it calls me to move!

I will dance before the Lord
With all the life He's given me
I'll use these hands to bear His light!

Now I'm reborn
Now I'm free!

[Outro]
Now I'm reborn...
Now I'm free...

I have tasted the Light
(Grace of the Living Son of God)
I have tasted the Light
(My heart is full, my heart is full)

I have tasted the Light...
In the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.
