        <p>
            I spent 26 years in the classroom teaching science to young people&mdash;helping them
            understand the natural world and discover the joy of asking good questions. Now,
            in what some might call retirement, I've found that the questions I most want to
            explore are the ones science alone can't answer.
        </p>

        <p>
            I'm an ordained Elder in the Melchizedek Priesthood of The Church of Jesus Christ
            of Latter-day Saints. My faith was shaped by years of study, service, and a mission
            to Argentina that changed how I see the world. But this ministry isn't about
            promoting one denomination over another&mdash;it's about Jesus Christ and the common
            ground shared by all who seek Him.
        </p>

        <p>
            Today, my wife and I travel in our RV, meeting people wherever we go. I host
            interfaith discussions in VR Chat, create music as part of the Powner Method,
            and write with the goal of making deep truths accessible. If you ever cross paths
            with a bald, bearded fellow talking about faith in a coffee shop or campground,
            it might be me.

<!-- Ministry Philosophy -->

        <h2>Ministry Philosophy</h2>

        <p>
            <strong class="text-gold">Christ-Centered, Not Tribal.</strong>
            I use the phrase "Christ-centered" rather than "Christian" deliberately.
            The word "Christian" has become, for many, a tribal marker&mdash;a way of asking
            "are you one of us?" I want to point to the person of Jesus Christ rather
            than to any institution's claim on Him.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong class="text-gold">Plainness Over Complexity.</strong>
            The name "Words of Plainness" comes from 2 Nephi 31:3&mdash;the idea that God speaks
            to His children in language they can understand. I believe truth is best served
            by clarity, not obscured by unnecessary complexity.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong class="text-gold">Faith Expressed in Living.</strong>
            I believe discipleship flows naturally from love&mdash;not as a transaction to earn
            salvation, but as the heart's natural response to grace. "If ye love me, keep
            my commandments" frames obedience as love's expression, not a checkbox requirement.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong class="text-gold">Bridges, Not Walls.</strong>
            Believers across traditions have more in common than the things that separate us.
            This ministry exists to explore that common ground without pretending our
            differences don't exist.

<!-- AI Disclosure -->

        <h2>AI Disclosure</h2>

        <p>
            In the spirit of transparency and trust, I want to be clear about how artificial
            intelligence is used in this ministry.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong class="text-gold">Writing Assistance:</strong>
            I use AI tools (specifically Claude, Gemini, chatGPT, Copilot, ElevenLabs, Suno,
            OpenArt, and a few related agentic AI tools) to assist with editing, formatting,
            refining and publishing my written content and deploying coding repositories. The
            ideas, theology, and personal reflections are my own; AI helps me express them more
            clearly and consistently. It also fills in gaps in my IT knowledgebase and artistic talents.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong class="text-gold">Website Development:</strong>
            AI has assisted in developing the technical infrastructure of this website, including
            code, design refinement, and accessibility features. These are hosted and coordinated
            between several services, including Bluehost, Github, Vercel, PythonAnywhere.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong class="text-gold">Scripture Study Tools:</strong>
            Some of the discipleship tools on this site use AI to help surface connections between
            scriptures and identify patterns in Christ's teachings (data mining).
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong class="text-gold">Verification Commitment:</strong>
            I recognize that AI can introduce errors&mdash;including fabricated scripture citations
            or theological drift. All AI-assisted content must be painstakingly mediated&ndash;and
            sometimes remediated and then verified against authoritative sources&ndash;before approval
            and publication. I am human, however. If you ever find an error, please
            <a href="/connect/#contact" class="text-gold">let me know</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
            The discipleship web apps and the main website are designed to support your own
            studies, not replace your personal engagement with the text.
        </p>

        <p>
            Regarding my current writing prose and style, I have thoroughly embraced both the
            em dash (&mdash;) and LLM AI as writing tools. I use the em dash&ndash;as many professional
            writers do&ndash;to add emphasis, interrupt flow, or signify a break in thought, mimicking
            natural speech patterns. Though currently associated with AI, it is a long-standing,
            traditional punctuation mark used for centuries in literature and journalism. Fair
            warning&ndash;the ideas that I have been writing about are more valuable than silly quibbles
            about rejecting words of others because they might be filtered through AI editorial processes.
        </p>

        <p>
            God bless you in your own spiritual journey. May He provide you with tools to assist you.

<!-- FAQ -->

    <div class="content-wrapper">
        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

        <h3 class="text-gold" style="margin-top: 1.5rem;">Are you trying to convert people to your church?</h3>
        <p>
            No. While I'm transparent about my Latter-day Saint background, this ministry is
            about following Jesus Christ and finding common ground among all who seek Him.
            I'm happy to answer questions about my faith tradition, but my goal is to point
            people to Christ, not to recruit for any institution.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-gold" style="margin-top: 1.5rem;">What if I don't believe in God yet?</h3>
        <p>
            You're welcome here. Honest questions are sacred. I'd rather walk alongside someone
            who's genuinely seeking than speak only to those who already agree with me.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-gold" style="margin-top: 1.5rem;">Do I need to agree with you to participate?</h3>
        <p>
            Not at all. Respectful dialogue across differences is exactly what this ministry is
            designed for. I learn from people who see things differently, and I hope you might
            find something useful here even if we disagree on some points.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-gold" style="margin-top: 1.5rem;">What does "Words of Plainness" mean?</h3>
        <p>
            It comes from 2 Nephi 31:3 in the Book of Mormon: "For my soul delighteth in plainness;
            for after this manner doth the Lord God work among the children of men." The idea is
            that spiritual truth should be communicated clearly&mdash;accessible to everyone, not just
            scholars or insiders.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-gold" style="margin-top: 1.5rem;">How can I support this ministry?</h3>
        <p>
            The best support is engagement&mdash;read, reflect, share what resonates, and
            <a href="/connect/#contact" class="text-gold">reach out</a> if you have questions
            or want to continue the conversation. If you'd like to support in other ways,
            please contact me directly.

        <h2>Glossary</h2>
        <p>
            Terms that may be unfamiliar to visitors from different faith backgrounds.
            This glossary aims to bridge language differences without assuming everyone
            shares the same vocabulary.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-gold" style="margin-top: 1.5rem;">Christ-centered</h3>
        <p>
            Oriented around Jesus Christ as the focus of faith and practice. Used here
            instead of "Christian" to emphasize the person of Christ rather than
            institutional or denominational identity.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-gold" style="margin-top: 1.5rem;">Covenant</h3>
        <p>
            A sacred agreement between God and His people. In many Christian traditions,
            covenants involve promises and commitments that shape the disciple's relationship
            with God.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-gold" style="margin-top: 1.5rem;">Discipleship</h3>
        <p>
            The practice of following Jesus Christ&mdash;learning from His teachings,
            emulating His example, and growing in faith over time.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-gold" style="margin-top: 1.5rem;">Latter-day Saint</h3>
        <p>
            A member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, sometimes
            informally called "Mormon." The term reflects the church's belief in
            being Christ's covenant people in the latter days before His return.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-gold" style="margin-top: 1.5rem;">Melchizedek Priesthood</h3>
        <p>
            In Latter-day Saint theology, the higher priesthood authority, named after
            the ancient priest-king Melchizedek mentioned in Genesis and Hebrews.
            Elders in this priesthood are authorized to perform certain ordinances
            and serve in leadership roles.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-gold" style="margin-top: 1.5rem;">Seeker</h3>
        <p>
            Someone exploring questions of faith, meaning, and God&mdash;whether from a
            position of doubt, curiosity, or spiritual awakening.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-gold" style="margin-top: 1.5rem;">Saint</h3>
        <p>
            In biblical usage, simply a believer&mdash;one who follows Christ. Paul addressed
            his letters to "the saints" at various churches. The term doesn't imply
            perfection but rather dedication to discipleship.
