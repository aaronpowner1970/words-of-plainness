        <h2>Welcome to Words of Plainness</h2>

        <p>Come in. Pull up a chair. There's room at the table.</p>

        <p>
            I'm Brother Aaron Powner&mdash;a retired science teacher, a lifelong student of scripture,
            and a fellow traveler on the path of faith. For years I've been asking the same questions
            you might be asking: Is God real? Is Jesus Christ who He claimed to be? And why do so many
            who love the same Savior spend so much energy on the things that divide us?
        </p>

        <p>This ministry exists for two kinds of visitors.</p>

        <h3 class="text-gold" style="margin-top: 2rem;">For Seekers</h3>
        <p>
            If you're someone honestly exploring whether faith makes sense, whether God is more than
            wishful thinking, whether Jesus of Nazareth deserves your attention&mdash;you're welcome here.
            I won't pressure you. I won't pretend the questions are easy. But I'll share what I've found,
            plainly and honestly.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-gold" style="margin-top: 2rem;">For Saints</h3>
        <p>
            If you're already a disciple of Christ&mdash;whatever tradition shaped your faith&mdash;you're equally
            welcome. Baptist, Catholic, Orthodox, Latter-day Saint, or something else entirely: I believe
            we share more common ground than our differences suggest. I'd like to explore that ground together.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-gold" style="margin-top: 2rem;">Why "Words of Plainness"?</h3>
        <p>
            The name comes from scripture&mdash;the idea that truth is best taught in plain, accessible language
            rather than complexity that obscures more than it reveals. That's my aim: clarity without
            condescension, depth without unnecessary difficulty.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-gold" style="margin-top: 2rem;">A Word About My Background</h3>
        <p>
            I'm an ordained Elder in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. That tradition has
            shaped my faith and my understanding of Jesus Christ. I don't hide it, but I also don't require
            you to share it. What I offer here is Christ-centered, grounded in scripture, and meant to build
            bridges rather than walls.
