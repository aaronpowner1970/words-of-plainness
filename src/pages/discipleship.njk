<!-- Introduction -->
<section class="content-section">
    <div class="content-wrapper">
        <p>
            Discipleship is faith in action&mdash;not earning salvation through works, but expressing
            love through living. These tools are designed to support your daily walk with Christ,
            helping you engage intentionally with His teachings and covenants.

            <p>
                "If ye love me, keep my commandments." This daily discipleship tool helps you
                track your intentional efforts to live covenant principles&mdash;not as a checklist
                for earning grace, but as a way to notice where your heart is reaching toward Christ.

            <h3 class="text-gold" style="margin-top: 1.5rem; font-size: 1.1rem;">How It Works</h3>
            <p>
                Each day, reflect on specific covenant commitments and note your efforts and growth.
                Over time, patterns emerge that reveal both your progress and areas where the Spirit
                might be inviting deeper change.

        <h3 class="text-gold">A Note on These Tools</h3>
        <p>
            These apps are aids, not replacements for personal scripture study, prayer, and
            the guidance of the Holy Spirit. Technology can support discipleship, but the
            real work happens in your heart and in your daily choices.
